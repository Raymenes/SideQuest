				<p>Behind every great woman, there is often another great woman who has encouraged her and listened to her and advised her, rather than tried to compete with her. That&#8217;s the way that it should be, according to Shine Theory, a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2013/05/shine-theory-how-to-stop-female-competition.html">concept that was crystalized</a> by journalist Ann Friedman in 2013 and embraced by women in the last presidential administration at the urging of Barack Obama himself.</p>
<p>As Obama&#8217;s former senior advisor <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/valerie-jarrett/" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="valerie-jarrett">Valerie Jarrett <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a> recalls its genesis in the White House, numerous women who&#8217;d been hired into the largely male administration began voicing their opinions less and less over time. &#8220;You had to really push your idea in, and [it was] totally exhausting,&#8221; Jarrett recalls in a new interview with the founder of TaskRabbit, <a class="crunchbase-link" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/leah-busque/" target="_blank" data-type="person" data-entity="leah-busque">Leah Busque <span class="crunchbase-tooltip-indicator"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Jarrett &#8212; who&#8217;d recruited many of the female senior officials and knew they were the &#8220;best and the brightest&#8221; &#8212; felt responsible for their happiness, so she voiced her concern. &#8220;I said to President Obama, &#8216;Watch and see. These women aren&#8217;t talking as much as they did at the beginning; they&#8217;re shying away.'&#8221;</p>
<p>In response, he proposed an idea. &#8220;He said, &#8216;I want them to come over and have dinner with me at my home and we&#8217;re going to talk about it,'&#8221; says Jarrett. They did, and it was a &#8220;frank and open dinner, and everyone explained to him their perspective, and he said, &#8216;I have your back. And when I&#8217;m not there, Valerie has your back.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama then asked the women to commit to having dinner regularly with Jarrett and to come back if they felt they needed to speak with him again. They didn&#8217;t, says Jarrett. Over the dinners, she tells Busque, &#8220;We&#8217;d built our own community.&#8221; Attendees aired grievances about the male colleagues. They discussed their children. They found &#8220;safety in numbers,&#8221; says Jarrett. Most importantly, she says, they found strength that they carried into their work.</p>
<p>Little wonder that Busque, whose company<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/28/16377528/ikea-acquisition-taskrabbit-shopping-home-contract-labor"> sold</a> to Ikea last year and who today <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/9/26/16371178/leah-busque-fuel-capital-taskrabbit-sale">works as a venture capitalist</a>, now wants to help women across a broad range of industries more easily come together to learn, to laugh, and to amplify each other&#8217;s power.</p>
<p>Toward that end, Busque has formed a new initiative called <a href="https://www.shinetogether.us/">Shine Together</a> with Task Rabbit&#8217;s former VP of marketing, Jamie Viggiano, that plans to organize dinners with women, feature content at its site like Busque&#8217;s sit-down with Jarrett, and to help up-and-coming businesswomen connect with needed mentors.</p>
<p>The organization, which quietly announced itself on Medium a few weeks ago, has already launched with a series of stories focused on notable women, including Jarrett; five-time Olympic medalist Nastia Liukin; and Ann Miura-Ko, the cofounding partner of the venture firm Floodgate.</p>
<p>Shine Together doesn&#8217;t merely feature women discussing their own paths, notably. It asks them to &#8220;shine a light on women who are behind the scenes but doing incredible stuff,&#8221; says Busque. Liukin, for example, talks in her interview about her mother. Miura-Ko talks about a sales executive, Stephanie Schatz, and their relationship.</p>
<p>For now, such video interviews will be published weekly and featured at Shine Together&#8217;s dedicated site. Over time, Viggiano &#8212; who is running the organization&#8217;s day-to-day operations &#8212; intends to work with distribution partners that are interested in making the content a part of their platforms, too.</p>
<p>As for the dinners, the idea is for powerful women to come and to bring a plus one &#8212; &#8220;someone who wouldn&#8217;t have access to this type of group,&#8221; Busque says. &#8220;We want to cast a wider net and give more women who deserve it [entrÃ©e] into these networking groups.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still early days, but you can learn more about the initiative <a href="https://www.shinetogether.us/">here</a>. Meanwhile, to learn more about Jarrett&#8217;s path in particular, you might check out Busque&#8217;s recent interview with her, below.</p>

and advised her, rather than tried to compete with her. That&#8217;s the way that it should be, according to Shine Theory, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecut.com\/2013\/05\/shine-theory-how-to-stop-female-competition.html\">concept that was crystalized<\/a> by journalist Ann Friedman in 2013 and embraced by women in the last presidential administration at the urging of Barack Obama himself.<\/p>\n<p>As Obama&#8217;s former senior advisor <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/valerie-jarrett\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"valerie-jarrett\">Valerie Jarrett <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> recalls its genesis in the White House, numerous women who&#8217;d been hired into the largely male administration began voicing their opinions less and less over time. &#8220;You had to really push your idea in, and [it was] totally exhausting,&#8221; Jarrett recalls in a new interview with the founder of TaskRabbit, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/leah-busque\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"person\" data-entity=\"leah-busque\">Leah Busque <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Jarrett &#8212; who&#8217;d recruited many of the female senior officials and knew they were the &#8220;best and the brightest&#8221; &#8212; felt responsible for their happiness, so she voiced her concern. &#8220;I said to President Obama, &#8216;Watch and see. These women aren&#8217;t talking as much as they did at the beginning; they&#8217;re shying away.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In response, he proposed an idea. &#8220;He said, &#8216;I want them to come over and have dinner with me at my home and we&#8217;re going to talk about it,'&#8221; says Jarrett. They did, and it was a &#8220;frank and open dinner, and everyone explained to him their perspective, and he said, &#8216;I have your back. And when I&#8217;m not there, Valerie has your back.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Obama then asked the women to commit to having dinner regularly with Jarrett and to come back if they felt they needed to speak with him again. They didn&#8217;t, says Jarrett. Over the dinners, she tells Busque, &#8220;We&#8217;d built our own community.&#8221; Attendees aired grievances about the male colleagues. They discussed their children. They found &#8220;safety in numbers,&#8221; says Jarrett. Most importantly, she says, they found strength that they carried into their work.<\/p>\n<p>Little wonder that Busque, whose company<a href=\"https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/9\/28\/16377528\/ikea-acquisition-taskrabbit-shopping-home-contract-labor\"> sold<\/a> to Ikea last year and who today <a href=\"https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/9\/26\/16371178\/leah-busque-fuel-capital-taskrabbit-sale\">works as a venture capitalist<\/a>, now wants to help women across a broad range of industries more easily come together to learn, to laugh, and to amplify each other&#8217;s power.<\/p>\n<p>Toward that end, Busque has formed a new initiative called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shinetogether.us\/\">Shine Together<\/a> with Task Rabbit&#8217;s former VP of marketing, Jamie Viggiano, that plans to organize dinners with women, feature content at its site like Busque&#8217;s sit-down with Jarrett, and to help up-and-coming businesswomen connect with needed mentors.<\/p>\n<p>The organization, which quietly announced itself on Medium a few weeks ago, has already launched with a series of stories focused on notable women, including Jarrett; five-time Olympic medalist Nastia Liukin; and Ann Miura-Ko, the cofounding partner of the venture firm Floodgate.<\/p>\n<p>Shine Together doesn&#8217;t merely feature women discussing their own paths, notably. It asks them to &#8220;shine a light on women who are behind the scenes but doing incredible stuff,&#8221; says Busque. Liukin, for example, talks in her interview about her mother. Miura-Ko talks about a sales executive, Stephanie Schatz, and their relationship.<\/p>\n<p>For now, such video interviews will be published weekly and featured at Shine Together&#8217;s dedicated site. Over time, Viggiano &#8212; who is running the organization&#8217;s day-to-day operations &#8212; intends to work with distribution partners that are interested in making the content a part of their platforms, too.<\/p>\n<p>As for the dinners, the idea is for powerful women to come and to bring a plus one &#8212; &#8220;someone who wouldn&#8217;t have access to this type of group,&#8221; Busque says. &#8220;We want to cast a wider net and give more women who deserve it [entr\u00e9e] into these networking groups.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s still early days, but you can learn more about the initiative <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shinetogether.us\/\">here<\/a>. Meanwhile, to learn more about Jarrett&#8217;s path in particular, you might check out Busque&#8217;s recent interview with her, below.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube embed breakout embed--video\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text\/html' width='640' height='390' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/qzpNLvLhA6Q?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Behind every great woman, there is often another great woman who has encouraged her and listened to her and advised her, rather than tried to compete with her.
