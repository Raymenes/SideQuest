{"title": ["Can SaaS principles transform political campaigns as we know them?"], "text": "In life, they say you get what you pay for. That is no less true in politics, which is fueled by campaign donations and lobbying dollars that move policy on every important issue under the sun. The disclosed expenditures of the DC lobbying industry are more than $3 billion per year, while just the presidential political campaigns spent more than $1.5 billion in 2016.Despite the key role that money plays in American politics, almost no one actually donates to a political campaign. According to the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets, just 0.68% of American adults donated more than $200 throughout the 2016 campaign cycle.A $200 contribution may sound like an extraordinary sum, but it\u2019s roughly $8.33 per month throughout the two-year election cycle. Compare the 1.67 million people engaged with politics against the subscription numbers elsewhere in the economy: The New York Times is approaching 3 million digital subscribers while Spotify and Netflix had 70 million and 118 million subscribers respectively in January this year.Watching House of Cards is certainly more fun than funding the real House of Cards, but the lack of engagement from voters in the money side of campaigns has serious, deleterious effects. As The New York Times pointed out, just 158 families donated roughly half of the early dollars in the 2016 election, giving this remarkably small sliver of the American people extraordinary influence over the course of policies that affect all of us.Unsurprisingly, the report cards for political institutions remain near their historical nadirs in the United States. Gallup polls show that just 15% of Americans approve of the work that Congress is doing, and cynicism increasingly runs rampant about the government\u2019s ability to improve the quality of life for citizens.At their heart, political campaigns are no different than any other organization: they need to raise revenues and then spend it to meet their objectives. Organizations are responsive to who pays them, and therefore, the only way to connect politics back to the everyday lives of people is to connect more pocketbooks of voters directly into the revenue model of DC.Lawrence Lessig, in his book Republic, Lost, believed such a system would likely tamp down the passions that exist in the present system. He wrote, \u201cYet in a system that was exclusively a small-donor system, candidates could not afford to fund their campaigns from the extremes only. Instead, with, for example, a voucher system, they would need to reach a much wider range of citizens. That breadth would preclude extremism. Like a mandatory voting system, a small-donor-funding regime would put constant pressure on representatives to hew to the mainstream.\u201dSmall donations have become popular on both the left and the right. Bernie Sanders raised tens of millions of dollars from donors giving less than $200, and Donald Trump has effectively leveraged his various platforms to drive Republicans to the highest small donor numbers in the party\u2019s history.Yet, it\u2019s not just small donations that are needed, but reliable streams of small donations, so that politicians could start to transition from dialing-for-dollars around-the-clock to actually doing the actual work of politics. It\u2019s the difference between selling songs one at a time, and a subscription service that has dedicated customers paying every month. In short, it is SaaS, but for politics.That\u2019s where startups like GiveMini become interesting. GiveMini, the product name of Progressive Labs, was started by Joel Aguero as a progressive-focused platform to help people donate their spare change to progressive candidates. Inspired by apps like Acorns and Digit, which help users save money for retirement, GiveMini\u2019s algorithm looks at your credit card transactions using Plaid, and then rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar, aggregates all this change, and sends the check to a campaign.In others words, it is change for change.\u201cAll of these little purchases are small acts of civil engagement,\u201d Aguero explained. His model works as follows. The average person has 32 transactions a month, and his rounding algorithm averages about 45 cents for each of those transactions. That comes out to about $14.40 a month, or just shy of $350 across a two-year election cycle. GiveMini scrapes a fee of 10% to cover its costs.The typical victorious congressional campaign spent $1.3 million, so if campaigns could sign up about 4,200 people for the entirety of an election cycle, they could cover all of their costs without resorting to tapping high-net-worth individuals at all.Aguero, who studied product design at Stanford, worked at such startups as Coursera and Nextdoor, as well as corporate behemoth Palantir. The 2016 election was a surprise to him, and he decided to find new ways to engage in politics using his background as a product designer. He was inspired by Bail Bloc, a cryptocurrency miner developed by The New Inquiry that generates money for people who couldn\u2019t pay their court bail. \u201cWhat if we did that, but for progressive political campaigns,\u201d Aguero asked. He proceeded to build a prototype over the next few months that would become GiveMini.The platform targets progressives, which as a term doesn\u2019t necessarily mean any Democrat. Its website says that \u201cGiveMini is for progressives. This includes many Democrats and Independents, and potentially some Republicans. We assess fit on a campaign-by-campaign basis and reserve the right to cease support for any campaign, candidate, or individual at any time.\u201dThe platform has built its first partnership with the campaign of Bryan Caforio, a Democrat running in California\u2019s 25th congressional district, which is located to the north of metro Los Angeles and is currently represented by Republican Steve Knight. \u201cThey are really excited about it because normally small donor donations go after existing supporters, and this has the potential to unlock an entirely different subset of donors,\u201d Aguero said. As the 2018 election heats up, \u201cI\u2019d like to get 100 campaigns on the platform by summer,\u201d he said. GiveMini has joined the most recent batch of Higher Ground Labs, which bills itself as an accelerator for progressive startups.One hundred campaigns is an ambitious target in an industry where the idea of small dollar subscriptions remains anathema. Candidates, particularly those running for national office, need to prove that they can raise large checks from large donors early on to be \u201cviable,\u201d in what is commonly known as the money race. Strong early money will often be leveraged with additional campaign committee dollars from DC, making it of critical importance to electoral success.Aguero understands that success around these new models of campaign financing may not pan out right away. \u201cWe have to be intentional about who we can really support and make sure it is a positive experience for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can walk out of this with some really compelling case studies, even if they are not very favorable,\u201d then GiveMini will have met its goals.Long term, Aguero hopes that \u201cwe can build an open source model among progressive campaigns.\u201d He\u2019s also not limiting his focus to politics, but hopes to include relevant non-profits on the network in the future, saying that \u201cA lot of the lessons we take from politics can be applied to the non-profit world as well.\u201d He thinks non-profits could be an important opportunity in the downtimes between elections.Washington\u2019s current expertise in stroking the egos of plutocrats will have to be replaced with more consumer-oriented marketing chops. Changing the capital\u2019s spending habits is not going to be easy, but reliable subscription revenue could change politics just as much as it has changed software business models. There is an opportunity to bring Silicon Valley\u2019s SaaS knowledge into DC, and in the process, affect lasting change that could transform our current political challenges.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/political-saas/"},
{"title": ["Snapchat brings back chronological Stories feed for some"], "text": "Snapchat has undone its controversial redesign\u2019s most significant change in an update to some users today. A tab that shows Stories in reverse chronological order, replacing the redesign\u2019s algorithmically sorted feed for many people.We\u2019ve reached out to Snap Inc and haven\u2019t heard back.Showing the most recent Stories first makes them predictable and coherent to browse. It helps you see what\u2019s going on with friends right now. That could be helpful if you wanted to find out which friends were free to hang out or if there\u2019s a party you could join.Users are seeing the reverse chronological Stories feed in both the design where there\u2019s just Stories and All tabs, as well as the design where there\u2019s separate Stories and Chat tabs.But reverse chronological order heavily prioritizes people who post frequently, which can bury your best friends. Snapchat\u2019s move towards algorithmic ranking in its big redesign ensured that people you watched Stories from or chatted with most showed up at the top so you\u2019d be less likely to miss their content. That\u2019s similar to how Facebook\u2019s feed worked for a long time, and how Instagram started ranking its feed two years ago. By moving social media stars and brands that don\u2019t follow you back over to the Discover section as part of the redesign, there\u2019s less noise in the chronological Stories list, so it works better than it did a year ago.Switching to algorithmic sorting has helped Instagram and Twitter boost growth, which is likely why Snapchat made it part of the redesign. The company had seen daily active user growth sag from 17 percent to under 3 per quarter after the launch of Facebook\u2019s Snapchat clone Instagram Stories. Snapchat saw growth improve after starting to roll out the algorithm-powered redesign in Q4 2017.For the most hardcore Snapchat users who check it constantly, today\u2019s update has been met with joy and gratitude. They were likely to see their closest friends\u2019 posts no matter when or how infrequently they posted.But ditching the algorithm could make it tougher for newer and less consistent Snapchat users who want to pop in and see the most relevant content instead of having to sort through distant acquaintances. That could inhibit growth. Essentially, Snapchat might have to decide between preferencing it\u2019s most engaged and loyal users, or aiming to add more casual users.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/snapchat-brings-back-chronological-stories-feed-for-some/"},
{"title": ["RSS is undead"], "text": "RSS died. Whether you blame Feedburner, or Google Reader, or Digg Reader last month, or any number of other product failures over the years, the humble protocol has managed to keep on trudging along despite all evidence that it is dead, dead, dead.Now, with Facebook\u2019s  scandal over Cambridge Analytica, there is a whole new wave of commentators calling for RSS to be resuscitated. Brian Barrett at Wired said a week ago that \u201c\u2026 anyone weary of black-box algorithms controlling what you see online at least has a respite, one that\u2019s been there all along but has often gone ignored. Tired of Twitter? Facebook fatigued? It\u2019s time to head back to RSS.\u201dLet\u2019s be clear: RSS isn\u2019t coming back alive so much as it is officially entering its undead phase.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love RSS. At its core, it is a beautiful manifestation of some of the most visionary principles of the internet, namely transparency and openness. The protocol really is simple and human-readable. It feels like how the internet was originally designed with static, full-text articles in HTML. Perhaps most importantly, it is decentralized, with no power structure trying to stuff other content in front of your face.It\u2019s wonderfully idealistic, but the reality of RSS is that it lacks the features required by nearly every actor in the modern content ecosystem, and I would strongly suspect that its return is not forthcoming.Now, it is important before diving in here to separate out RSS the protocol from RSS readers, the software that interprets that protocol. While some of the challenges facing this technology are reader-centric and therefore fixable with better product design, many of these challenges are ultimately problems with the underlying protocol itself.Let\u2019s start with users. I, as a journalist, love having hundreds of RSS feeds organized in chronological order allowing me to see every single news story published in my areas of interest. This use case though is a minuscule fraction of all users, who aren\u2019t paid to report on the news comprehensively. Instead, users want personalization and prioritization \u2014 they want a feed or stream that shows them the most important content first, since they are busy and lack the time to digest enormous sums of content.To get a flavor of this, try subscribing to the published headlines RSS feed of a major newspaper like the Washington Post, which publishes roughly 1,200 stories a day. Seriously, try it. It\u2019s an exhausting experience wading through articles from the style and food sections just to run into the latest update on troop movements in the Middle East.Some sites try to get around this by offering an array of RSS feeds built around keywords. Yet, stories are almost always assigned more than one keyword, and keyword selection can vary tremendously in quality across sites. Now, I see duplicate stories and still manage to miss other stories I wanted to see.Ultimately, all of media is prioritization \u2014 every site, every newspaper, every broadcast has editors involved in determining what is the hierarchy of information to be presented to users. Somehow, RSS (at least in its current incarnation) never understood that. This is both a failure of the readers themselves, but also of the protocol, which never forced publishers to provide signals on what was most and least important.Another enormous challenge is discovery and curation. How exactly do you find good RSS feeds? Once you have found them, how do you group and prune them over time to maximize signal? Curation is one of the biggest on-boarding challenges of social networks like Twitter and Reddit, which has prevented both from reaching the stratospheric numbers of Facebook. The cold start problem with RSS is perhaps its greatest failing today, although could potentially be solved by better RSS reader software without protocol changes.RSS\u2019 true failings though are on the publisher side, with the most obvious issue being analytics. RSS doesn\u2019t allow publishers to track user behavior. It\u2019s nearly impossible to get a sense of how many RSS subscribers there are, due to the way that RSS readers cache feeds. No one knows how much time someone reads an article, or whether they opened an article at all. In this way, RSS shares a similar product design problem with podcasting, in that user behavior is essentially a black box.For some users, that lack of analytics is a privacy boon. The reality though is that the modern internet content economy is built around advertising, and while I push for subscriptions all the time, such an economy still looks very distant. Analytics increases revenues from advertising, and that means it is critical for companies to have those trackers in place if they want a chance to make it in the competitive media environment.RSS also offers very few opportunities for branding content effectively. Given that the brand equity for media today is so important, losing your logo, colors, and fonts on an article is an effective way to kill enterprise value. This issue isn\u2019t unique to RSS \u2014 it has affected Google\u2019s AMP project as well as Facebook Instant Articles. Brands want users to know that the brand wrote something, and they aren\u2019t going to use technologies that strip out what they consider to be a business critical part of their user experience.These are just some of the product issues with RSS, and together they ensure that the protocol will never reach the ubiquity required to supplant centralized tech corporations. So, what are we to do then if we want a path away from Facebook\u2019s hegemony?I think the solution is a set of improvements. RSS as a protocol needs to be expanded so that it can offer more data around prioritization as well as other signals critical to making the technology more effective at the reader layer. This isn\u2019t just about updating the protocol, but also about updating all of the content management systems that publish an RSS feed to take advantage of those features.That leads to the most significant challenge \u2014 solving RSS as business model. There needs to be some sort of a commerce layer around feeds, so that there is an incentive to improve and optimize the RSS experience. I would gladly pay money for an Amazon Prime-like subscription where I can get unlimited text-only feeds from a bunch of a major news sources at a reasonable price. It would also allow me to get my privacy back to boot.Next, RSS readers need to get a lot smarter about marketing and on-boarding. They need to actively guide users to find where the best content is, and help them curate their feeds with algorithms (with some settings so that users like me can turn it off). These apps could be written in such a way that the feeds are built using local machine learning models, to maximize privacy.Do I think such a solution will become ubiquitous? No, I don\u2019t, and certainly not in the decentralized way that many would hope for. I don\u2019t think users actually, truly care about privacy (Facebook has been stealing it for years \u2014 has that stopped its growth at all?) and they certainly aren\u2019t news junkies either. But with the right business model in place, there could be enough users to make such a renewed approach to streams viable for companies, and that is ultimately the critical ingredient you need to have for a fresh news economy to surface and for RSS to come back to life.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-07 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/07/rss-is-undead/"},

It\u2019s a weird industry because a significant part of the traffic on those reference websites comes from search engines. And Google Translate is quite dominant as well.So how do you go beyond search engine optimization? Reverso has been building many different services to become your go-to destination when it comes to your language needs. For instance, you can translate a word or a sentence and find contextual examples. You can access verb conjugation, translate big chunks of text, access traditional dictionaries and more.More interestingly, the company has been focused on language learning for its mobile app. Every time you search for something, you can add a word to your phrasebook. After that, you can then go through your phrasebook with a quiz to learn those words.Your data will get synced across multiple devices as long as you\u2019re logged in. You could install Reverso\u2019s Chrome extension to add words to the mobile app for instance.If you don\u2019t have time to add words yourself, the company is also putting together lists of not-so-simple-but-generally-useful words. The idea is that you could be learning new words when you\u2019re waiting in line instead of wasting time scrolling through feeds.In addition to those new exercices, Reverso now has an integrated thesaurus. You can search for a word and tap the tiny \u201cS\u201d in the corner to access related words. The company has been crunching all its translations to put this together. Chances are that two words that have the same translation in multiple languages probably mean the same thing.Reverso isn\u2019t necessarily reinventing the wheel with all those services.

ABCmouse, Age of Learning\u2019s flagship product, has been localized and will be available as a website and an iOS and Android app in China, with Tencent handling product development, marketing, sales and customer support.The new partnership extends Tencent\u2019s involvement in ed-tech, which already includes a strategic investment in VIPKID, an online video tutoring platform that connects Chinese kids with English teachers and competes with QKids and Dada ABC. ABCmouse, on the other hand, uses videos, books and online activities like games, songs and stories to help kids study English.The Chinese version of ABCmouse includes integration with Tencent\u2019s ubiquitous messenger and online services platform WeChat, which now has more than one billion users, and its instant messaging service QQ, with 783 million monthly active users. This makes it easier for parents to sign up and pay for ABCmouse, because they can use their WeChat or QQ account and payment information. It also allows families to share kids\u2019 English-learning progress on their news feeds or in chats. For example, Jerry Chen, Age of Learning\u2019s  president of Greater China, says parents can send video or audio recordings of their children practicing English to grandparents, who can then buy gift subscriptions with one click.Though you probably haven\u2019t heard of it unless you have young kids or work with elementary school-age children, Age of Learning has built a significant presence in online education since it was founded in 2007, thanks mainly to the popularity of ABCmouse in schools, public libraries and Head Start programs. Two years ago, Age of Learning hit unicorn status after raising $150 million at a $1 billion valuation from Iconiq Capital.The partnership lets ABCmouse tap into a major new audience. Chen says there are more than 110 million kids between the ages of three to eight in China and the online English language learning market there is \u201ca several billion dollar market that\u2019s growing rapidly.\u201d He points to a recent study by Chinese research agency Yiou Intelligence that says total spending on online English learning programs for children will be 29.41 billion RMB, or about $4.67 billion, this year, and is projected to reach 79.17 billion, or $12.6 billion, by 2022.The localization of ABCmouse will extend to the design of its eponymous cartoon rodent, who has a more stylized appearance in China. Lessons include animations featuring an English teacher and students in an international school classroom and begin with listening comprehension and speaking before moving onto phonics, reading and writing.\u00a0Tencent-Age of Learning products will also include speech recognition tools to help kids hone their English pronunciation.In an email, Jason Chen, Tencent\u2019s general manager of online education, said that the company \u201creviewed several companies through an extensive research process, and it became clear that ABCmouse had the most engaging and effective online English self-learning curriculum and content for children.

Our business at Alibaba is already seeing tangible benefits from our investments in AI and we are committed to further investment,\u201d said Joe Tsai, Alibaba\u2019s executive\u00a0vice chairman.SenseTime said it has more than 400 customers across a range of verticals including fintech, automotive, fintech, smartphones, smart city development and more that include Honda, Nvidia, China\u2019s UnionPay, Weibo,\u00a0China Merchants Bank, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi.Perhaps its most visible partner is the Chinese government, which uses its systems for its national surveillance system.\u00a0SenseTime process data captured by China\u2019s 170 million CCTV cameras and newer systems which include smart glasses worn by police offers on the street.China has placed vast emphasis on tech development, with AI one of its key flagposts.A government program aims to make the country the world leader in AI technology by 2030, the New York Times reported, by which time it is estimated that the industry could be worth some $150 billion per year. SenseTime\u2019s continued development fees directly into that ambition.\u201cAI is really changing every profession and every industry. There\u2019s almost nothing that won\u2019t be touched by AI,\u201d investor Kai-Fu Lee, formerly the head of Google in China, said at a TechCrunch event\u00a0back in 2016.Even two years ago, the potential\u00a0was\u00a0evident, with Lee explaining that teaching, medicine and healthcare were obvious areas for disruption.Perhaps the main difference between the state of AI development in the U.S. and China is that, in America, much of the technology is being developed in big tech firms like Amazon and Google. In China, however, companies like SenseTime and its rival\u00a0Megvii (which develops the Face++ platform) are independent entities that operate with the financial backing of giants like Alibaba.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/sensetime-raises-600-million/"},
{"title": ["SurvAIllance"], "text": "You may not be aware that the rough consensus in the tech community is that Cambridge Analytica were almost certainly bullshit artists. Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong, what they tried to do, and/or claimed to do, was super shady and amoral and would have been ruinous to reasonable informed democracy if successful. But I have yet to find anyone credible who thinks that their \u201cpsychographics\u201d approach actually works.That is: it doesn\u2019t work yet.We may yet thank Cambridge Analytica, for inadvertently raising the red flag before the real invaders are at the gate. Because in this era of ongoing exponential leaps and growths in data collection, which is also an era of revolutionary, transformative AI advancement, it\u2019s probably only a matter of time before electorates can be subtly manipulated wholesale.Don\u2019t take my word for it. Take that of Google senior AI / deep-learning researcher Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, in a truly remarkable Twitter thread:To quote the crux of what he\u2019s saying:Does this sound excessively paranoid? Then let me point your attention to another eye-opening recent Twitter thread, in which Jeremy Ashkenas enumerates a set of Facebook\u2019s more dystopian patent applications:Again let me just summarize the highlights:Are those quotes out of context? They sure are! So I encourage you to explore the context. I think you\u2019ll find that, as Ashkenas puts it, \u201cthese patent applications don\u2019t necessarily mean that Facebook wants to use any of these techniques. Instead, they illustrate the kinds of possibilities that Facebook management imagines.\u201dAn explosion of data. A revolution in AI, which uses data as its lifeblood. How could any tech executive not imagine using these dramatic developments in new and groundbreaking ways? I don\u2019t want to just beat up on Facebook. They are an especially easy target, but they are not the only fish in this barrel:Here\u2019s yet another viral privacy-related Twitter thread, this time from Dylan Curran, illustrating just how much data Facebook and Google almost certainly have on you:Mind you, it seems fair to say that Google takes the inherent dangers and implicit responsibility of all this data collection, and the services it provides with this data, far, far more seriously than Facebook does. Facebook\u2019s approach to potential malfeasance has been \u2026 well \u2026 let me point you to still another Twitter thread, this one from former Google Distinguished Engineer Yonatan Zunger, who I think speaks for all of us here while reacting to reports of Facebook\u2019s CTO saying \u201cthe company is now mapping out potential threats from bad actors before it launches products.\u201dBut the larger point is that the problem is not restricted to Facebook, or Google, or the big tech companies. It\u2019s more acute with them, since they have more data and more power, and, in Facebook\u2019s case, very little apparent sense that with great power comes great responsibility.But the real problem is far more fundamental. When your business model turns data into money, then you are, implicitly, engaging in surveillance capitalism.Surveillance and privacy are issues not limited to businesses, of course; consider the facial recognition goggles already in use by Chinese police, or India\u2019s colossal fingerprint-face-and-retina-driven Aadhaar program, or dogged attempts by the UK and US governments to use your phone or your Alexa as their surveillance device. But corporations currently seem to be the sharp and amoral edge of this particular wedge, and we have no real understanding of how to mitigate or eliminate the manifold and growing dangers of their surveillance capitalism.I\u2019m not saying all data gathering is ipso facto bad; but I am saying that, given the skyrocketing quantity of sensors and data in our world, and the ability to tie that data to individuals, any initiatives which support privacy, pseudonymity, and anonymity should be considered desirable until proven otherwise, given the ever-growing oceans of data whose tides threaten to wash those lonely islands away.I\u2019m certainly not saying AI is bad. Its potential for improving our world is immense. But like every powerful tool, we need to start thinking about how its potential misuses and side effects before we rush to use it at scale.And I\u2019m saying we should almost be grateful to Cambridge Analytica, for selling snake oil which claimed to do what tomorrow\u2019s medicines actually will. Let\u2019s not overreact with a massive moral panic. (checks Internet) Whoops, too late. OK, fine \u2014 but let\u2019s try to take advantage of this sense of panic to calmly and rationally forestall the real dangers, before they arrive.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/survaillance/"},

{"title": ["Tap Bio\u2019s mini-sites solve Instagram\u2019s profile link problem"], "text": "You only get one link on Instagram, but Tap Bio  lets you point that to a customized landing page full of all the sites you want to share. Rather than constantly changing your Instagram profile URL, you can easily add slides equipped with links to your Tap Bio corresponding to your latest Instagram posts. Tap Bio could be a powerful tool for social media stars, digital entrepreneurs or anyone trying to market themselves via Instagram. Tap Bio is About.me for the next generation. You can see it in action here.It\u2019s a deceptively simple idea, yet one that the big website-creation platforms like Squarespace, Wix and Weebly have missed. It\u2019s dumbfounding that there\u2019s no popular mobile-first site builder, though an app called Universe was one of the hottest companies that graduated from Y Combinator\u2019s accelerator this month. But by starting with an obvious problem, the bootstrapped Tap Bio could gain a foothold in a business dominated by heavily funded startups, and angle to become the center of your online identity. People interested can sign up for the private beta here.The whole reason for Tap Bio\u2019s existence is a brilliant decision of Instagram\u2019s. You can\u2019t post links, and you get just one link in your profile. URLs in post captions don\u2019t hyperlink and can\u2019t be copied. That means the focus is on sharing beauty, not driving clicks. But promoters gonna promote, so the \u201cLink in bio\u201d trend began. Instagrammers change their profile link to where they want to send people, then mention that much-derided phrase hoping their followers will open their profile and click-through. Unfortunately, though, anyone reading one of their older posts might be confused when the \u201clink in bio\u201d has changed to point somewhere unrelated.\u201cThe fact that you can\u2019t link from posts has contributed to the quality of the experience,\u201d says Tap Bio CEO Jesse Engle. \u201cBut it\u2019s created a major pain point for people who are promoting something, which is a lot of people.\u201d Engle is experienced with filling social platform gaps. He co-founded Twitter scheduling and multi-account management app CoTweet in 2008, which sold to ExactTarget in 2010 and eventually became part of Salesforce. Over the past few years, he and Tap Bio co-founder\u00a0Ryan Walker, who just left Apple, have been running Link In Profile, a more basic but similar tool that just recreates your Instagram profile but with links attached to each post.With Tap Bio, you set it as your Instagram profile link, and then create different cards to show on your mini-site. One can show two columns of your recent Instagram posts that instantly open whichever link you want to pair with each. Another offers a more visual full-screen profile with links to your other social media presences, like on Twitter and YouTube. There\u2019s a focused, single-link call to action page if you\u2019ve got one big thing to promote. And Tap Bio is adding more card styles.Tap Bio is \u201cforever free\u201d if you only want one profile card and one of any other card; $5 per month gets you three extra plus analytics, while $12 per month grants unlimited cards across up to three Instagram accounts \u2014 though there are discounts for yearly billing. It will compete with traditional site builders and less-polished alternatives, like Linkin.bio and Linktree.But the biggest risk for Tap Bio isn\u2019t competition, it\u2019s\u00a0its host platform. Instagram could always shut down links out to Tap Bio. After all, it did just suddenly kill off a big part of its API three months ahead of schedule as part of Facebook\u2019s big data privacy crackdown. Luckily, Engle says, \u201cwe\u2019re mitigating this risk by building a close relationship with Instagram, openly sharing our plans and offering whatever value we can to them. They\u2019ve been very helpful in sharing their plans, and we are confident that we\u2019ll continue to play a role in this space well into the future.\u201dTap Bio\u2019s potential goes far beyond Instagram, though. It could become the hub for your web presence. About.me is outdated, Twitter\u2019s too temporal, Facebook\u2019s too personal,\u00a0LinkedIn\u2019s too formal and Instagram\u2019s too informal. Unless you have your own full-fledged website, it\u2019s unclear which one link your should give people you meet online or off. If Tap Bio plays it right, it could become your digital calling card.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/tap-bio/"},

Period.\u201cYou read the whitepaper right? Bona fide golden ticket. You want to be cut in? I could pull some strings if you\u2019re keen but you\u2019ll need at least $100k for phase I. We\u2019ll be going up 100x or more in later rounds. We\u2019re not after tiddlers or hodlers or whatever they\u2019re called. Just top tier investment funds.\u201cOkay, okay, a few family offices in Saudi, Qatar \u2014 and Puget and Scranton. Gotta keep our little local connection happy.\u201dHe laughs a little too heartily.\u201cWe\u2019ve also been talking to SoftBank. Masayoshi might join the board. He\u2019s very interested in the long term future of crab futures.\u201dPoney has the face of a man who\u2019s eaten more than his fair share of crab dinners.\nBut he cuts into our next question \u2014 about how much Krablr  is targeting for its token sale \u2014 to bark into a lobster-handled landline telephone, summoning an afternoon snack.Is that an original Dal\u00ed, your correspondent wonders. Poney ignores all our questions.\u201cHow do I know these crab sticks are going to be fucking great? Blockchain that\u2019s how. It\u2019s a fucking miracle.\u201cPeople have been emailing me saying they\u2019re selling their grandmothers to get into KrabCoin,\u201d he adds. \u201cFucking A-Okay. As I always told grammy, nothing beats the smell of capitalism in the morning.\u201dHe takes a huge sniff of his own air.\u201cAll the time actually. It smells like fresh cooked crab. Maybe that\u2019s just me. My girlfriend thinks capitalism smells like diamonds \u2014 but that was after I gave her a 22 carat diamond necklace. I had the rock cut into the shape of a carapace.\u201dHe flashes a full set of brilliantly pearly teeth.\u201cAnyway, where was I? \u2014 blockchain! Did you see my number plate? There\u2019s only one car parking space here. Y\u2019know how it is with land in the Bay. But I don\u2019t mind telling you this office was cheaper than Fresno. Marine mid shallows is actually a criminally untapped opportunity. We\u2019re going to be using a chunk of the ICO to plough into underwater real estate. Think Manhattan in an aquarium with underwater drones to ferry you home and jellyfish waving you to beddie byes. I can send you the brochure if you\u2019re interested.\u201cAnyway the lobster-colored lambo in the lot is mine. Did you notice the plate? It\u2019s the timestamp of Satoshi\u2019s Genesis block. I paid a small fortune to some guy in the Mission to peel it off his electric scooter. I\u2019d have happily paid twice.\u201cPeople are going to say I\u2019m fucking Satoshi himself soon!\u201dPoney ejects another ripe belly laugh. Or it might have been a belch. His assistant hurries into the room carrying a large platter of crab sticks.\u201cAt last! I could murder a bucket of lobster! Help yourself to the shrimp. It\u2019s blockchain certified.\u201dSo why did Krablr move its HQ to SF? Was it to be closer to Pacific crab catches?Poney pauses his vigorous mastication for a moment. \u201cHow much crab is left in the Pacific?\u201d he muses. \u201cNo one knows. Truly no one. But they will know \u2014 we\u2019ll be putting all that on the blockchain.\u201cFrankly I\u2019d put my grammy on the blockchain if I could. You can quote me on that.\u201dHe grins wolfishly through a mouthful of crabs sticks and then laughs with gusto, blasting the room with fragments of impossibly fresh crab meat.\u201cPot baits, carapace metrics, poundage, sex distribution, discards, toss backs, deadloss, offload times,\u201d he reels off, staccato style, after his last gulp. \u201cYou\u2019ll know exactly how many deckhands manhandled your dinner. Down to the color of their fucking fingernails.\u201cNow tell me that\u2019s not worth $1TR?\u201d\u201cHere, take a claw,\u201d he adds, tossing a souvenir of his snack towards the door without waiting for an answer. \u201cYou can tell your friends you got yourself a bite of KrabCoin.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/krablrs-ico-is-cookin-on-gas/"},
{"title": ["Parasitism and the fight for the wrong century"], "text": "Generals are famously always \u201cstudying how to fight the last war,\u201d with the last war\u2019s technology, while dismissing how the world and its tech have changed in the interim. This is true for dissidents, rebels, and culture wars too. Our fears tend to be of 20th century boogeymen, the Nazis and the Soviet Union \u2014 but we should be worrying about other things entirely. The world and its dystopias have moved on.The Nazis and the Soviets obviously inspired Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984,\u201d which was stunning, visionary, and enormously influential \u2026 while still being slightly myopic compared to Huxley\u2019s earlier, much weirder, and much more subversive \u201cBrave New World.\u201d But Orwell too was already able to prophesy a world in which no one really fought for territory any more. What would be the point?Militaries around the world are constructed primarily for national defense against an invading, conquering force, but invading and conquering territory makes no sense any more. Wealth and power are no longer remotely related to how much real estate or raw materials you control. South Korea\u2019s US-dollar GDP is higher than that of Russia.The US swept Iraq\u2019s military away like gauze paper when they invaded in 2003, but it turns out that, even after you overthrow a brutal dictator, even when it\u2019s one of the most oil-rich nations on the planet, attempting to occupy and control a hostile nation inevitably becomes a horribly expensive catastrophe that costs enormously more than any possible benefits.Nation-states don\u2019t invade and conquer each other any more because of military defenses, or any kind of Pax Americana, or because everyone has gotten nicer and kinder over the last hundred years. They don\u2019t do it because, thanks to technology-driven transformations over that time, it simply doesn\u2019t make any sense; in fact it has become complete madness.Similarly, counterculture individualists and lovers of freedom worry about Nazi fascism or Soviet police states. How twentieth century of us. There are plenty of neo-fascists out there, to my dismay, and we often seem to be doing our best to accidentally construct the tools of a police state out of modern technology \u2014 smartphones, drones, facial recognition technology, etc. in the much-abused name of \u201csecurity.\u201d I\u2019m certainly not suggesting that people or societies today are somehow less likely to construct such horrors because they have grown morally better over time. There are plenty of awful people out there.I am, however, suggesting that awful people today are a lot less likely to aim for fascism or totalitarianism because awful people benefit a lot less from those systems than they used to. The Soviet Union collapsed because it was an economic disaster as well as a moral one. The closest things we have to fascist states today \u2014 monarchies like North Korea and Saudi Arabia \u2014 are fragile, riven by internal contradictions and internecine warfare, facing the future with desperation and fear.There\u2019s a new playbook for oppression today. Instead of outright totalitarian rule, you construct the appearance of democracy, while controlling it by subtly \u2014 in some cases perhaps not even consciously \u2014 restricting the options available to individual voters; by controlling a tiered system of \u201crepresentative\u201d electors behind the scenes; or by simply outright stuffing the ballot box. (There can be much sound and fury about the distinctions between the available candidates, but if you\u2019ve done your job correctly, and made democracy as awful as possible, in general only establishment candidates or easily manipulated narcissists will ever be nominated.)Then you give your people enough freedom to thrive; to create, to disrupt, to innovate. And you siphon as much as you can of that created wealth.You don\u2019t give them enough to actually seriously challenge the establishment, of course; to, say, remake the system so that the siphoned wealth goes to its poor and oppressed people instead of its silent, invisible masters. That is a red line that must not be crossed. But the beauties of this system \u2014 call it parasitism \u2014 is that it is very rare to encounter a challenger who cannot be co-opted. It vampire-squids enough wealth for its upper-tier members and their families to live lives of extraordinary, gilded luxury, without the unpleasant threat of being assassinated or deposed that comes with outright fascism or totalitarianism.These parasitic systems couldn\u2019t exist without today\u2019s technology. They are mostly networked, not hierarchical. They watch, they adapt, and they distract. They construct shell corporations that shuttle gobs of money around the globe like 747s. And they very rarely need to resort to violence, because, like the Borg, and like capitalism itself \u2014 from which it is distinct, although there are places where it has been so successful that people rarely recognize any difference \u2014 parasitism usually has the capacity to absorb all those who confront it.I\u2019m not saying fascism and totalitarianism are things we should be completely unworried about. They\u2019re out there, they\u2019re real, and they\u2019re terrifying. But there are playbooks for how to fight them. Parasitism, though, seems almost unstoppable.

{"title": ["Patterns, Predictability, and the Rise of Donald Trump\u00a0"], "text": "Think you\u2019ve heard that song before? Were there more Jennifer\u2019s or Jessica\u2019s in your class at school? And what does this have to do with the rise of Donald Trump?In the latest episode of the Interesting People in Interesting Times podcast,\u00a0Derek Thompson, author of\u00a0Hitmakers: The Science of Popularity in an Age of Distraction, explains what influences our thinking, drives our choices, and ultimately dictates human behavior.Thompson argues that\u00a0patterns and predictability are the essence of human life.\u00a0What makes a hit song, a winning politician, a bestselling product, and even a successful tech startup, comes down to repetition.\u00a0At the core of Thompson\u2019s theory is the\u00a0myth of novelty: We seemingly love to discover new things, but they only resonate with us if they\u2019re grounded in an element of familiarity.\u201cWe live in a culture where there\u2019s enormous pressure to be aware of and to like new things, to be aware of new songs, to see new movies, to read new books, to seek out new ideas, to be up on the hottest fashion or the most salacious thing happening on Twitter,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cYet the most fundamental finding from psychology is that people do not like new things. The [concept of] the mere-exposure effect says that the mere exposure to any stimulus to us biases us towards that stimulus: we are suckers for the familiar.\u201d\u201cTake movies. We love to see new movies. That said, every year this century, a majority of the top 10 films in America have been sequels, adaptations, or reboots. This is even true in the landscape of ideas.\u00a0It\u2019s thrilling and wonderful to read a brilliant essay but\u00a0what we love and pass on the most is those essays that have a clever joke or framing device to tell us that that thing we believe in is in fact true.\u201d\u00a0The\u00a0reason we fall for certain people and products comes down to \u201cfamiliar surprises: ideas that strike us as original when we confront them, but in investigating them, it\u2019s like stepping through a door and seeing an old friend on the inside.\u00a0Discovering a feeling of familiarity within products and discovering a-ha moments is what all consumers are looking for throughout the cultural landscape.\u201d\u00a0In politics, Thompson says,\u00a0\u201cWe love new faces. But\u00a0we only fall for them when they tell us familiar stories.\u201d\u00a0For example, \u201cMake America Great Again is not only the most traditional thing you could possibly say, but it\u2019s so traditional, Ronald Reagan said it 28 years ago.\u201d\u201cFor a long period of time, elites could use scarce media channels like radio to dictate taste to consumers, and consumers through sheer repetition and familiarity bias would lap up the ideas of the elites. Taste was top-down for most of history, but now it\u2019s bottom-up.\u201dWhat does that have to do with Donald Trump?The dominant theory in political science about elections was called \u201cthe party decides\u201d \u2014 voters don\u2019t decide who becomes the presidential nominee of any particular party. The party decides. The party equals the elites. The exact same phenomenon that\u2019s happening in music, is happening in politics. But now, you have this explosion in the channels of exposure.\u201cTaste in politics, just like taste in music, has gone from being dictated top down to where it bubbles up. Across the cultural landscape, taste itself is becoming more chaotic, harder to predict, harder to control.\u201dTurns out, the structure of making a hit song, and its devices, like repetition, are key to political speechwriting, as well as marketing.The most famous line in speech making in the 20th century is John F. Kennedy\u2019s\u00a0\u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\u201d\u00a0Mark Twain said\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the dog in the fight, it\u2019s the size of the fight in the dog.\u201d\u00a0Hillary Clinton\u2019s  perhaps most well-known line is:\u00a0\u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe reason this is so common in speechwriting, so clever and so powerful, is that it turns ideas into music through repetition. It takes any concept and musicalizes it so that our brain falls in love with the music before it even has time to process the substance.\u201dAnd here\u2019s where this connects to\u00a0Andrew Yang, who is running for President in 2020,\u00a0as featured in the first episode of the IPIT podcast.< According to Thompson, \u201cAndrew Yang is selling a huge proposal with Universal Basic Income. And he\u2019s selling it based on a rather large, scary principle: that our jobs are going away in way that\u2019s never happened before. I think it\u2019s important for politicians to have huge visions, particularly when those visions are based in an element of morality. I would urge him however to find more ways to fit the concept of a freedom dividend within the system that we have, by suggesting, for example, that he\u2019s open to doubling or tripling the income tax credit. Or by suggesting that he\u2019s willing to expand Medicare maybe from 65 to 55 and even to 45, and that he has plans to expand Medicaid as well. I think that having an element of radical idealism is really really important for running for president. But it\u2019s important that we ground our visions of radicalism to an element of familiarity, because politics, like music, is a popularizing business. Running for president is essentially the largest popularity contest in the U.S. And we know people are afraid of ideas that sound too radical.\u201dThe takeaway here is:\u00a0\u201cDream as big as possible, but just as it\u2019s important to sell something familiar by making it surprising, if you\u2019re trying to sell something surprising, do remember to make it familiar.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Interesting People in Interesting Times is a podcast hosted by Tom Goodwin and Adriana Stan.

{"title": ["Nostalgia eats itself in \u2018Ready Player One\u2019"], "text": "First things first: I had a good time watching Ready Player One. As promised, the movie feels like a chance for Steven Spielberg to return to his roots as a blockbuster filmmaker, and to take all the toys out of the box and smash them together.The film is based on Ernest Cline\u2019s bestselling novel, with a script by Cline and Zak Penn. It\u2019s ostensibly set in Columbus, Ohio, 30 years in the future, in a world overwhelmed by climate change and overpopulation.\u00a0But Ready Player One\u2019s real setting is the OASIS, an enormous virtual reality world.The story\u2019s hero is Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan), who spends most of his time in the OASIS, hoping to complete three challenges \u00a0left behind by James Halliday, the technology\u2019s inventor. Halliday has promised that the first person to complete the challenges will gain control of the OASIS.The film\u2019s central achievement is bringing this virtual world to life. Rather than aiming for a photo-real effect, Spielberg has embraced the OASIS\u2019 essentially cartoony and video game-like qualities, and after a few minutes of acclimation, I had no problem jumping back-and-forth between the movie\u2019s digital free-for-all and its live action dystopia.It\u2019s clear that the characters take what happens in the OASIS as seriously as anything in the \u201creal world,\u201d and that they see their virtual avatars as an extension or expression of their real selves, so I was happy to follow their lead.And as Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Wreck-it Ralph have already shown, there can be something exhilarating about seeing elements from classic films and video games thrown together. I genuinely felt like I was 10 years old again as I watched the first big set piece, with Wade racing through the streets of New York City in his Back to the Future-style DeLorean, dodging King Kong and the Tyrannosaurus from Jurassic Park.But I also felt a rapidly growing sense of diminishing returns.True, Spielberg and other directors of his generation have openly borrowed from old movies throughout their careers. Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were inspired by the pop culture that Spielberg and his friend George Lucas loved as kids, but those movies transformed what had come before into something new.There\u2019s nothing quite as magical here. At its worst, Ready Player One amounts to little more than a game of spot-the-reference. And even at its best, any excitement feels more like a rapidly fading sugar rush, not the indelible thrill of Spielberg\u2019s best work.He\u2019s been happy to talk about Ready Player One as a return to making movies \u201cfrom the audience, for the audience,\u201d but\u00a0Spielberg\u2019s also suggested that he has more on his mind than pure entertainment \u2014 that the film is meant to highlight some of the ways that the Internet and virtual reality could be used to isolate us, to distract from the world\u2019s very real problems.Some of that comes across in the film\u2019s opening moments, when Wade climbs down a tower of rundown trailers. Inside each one, we can see that his neighbors are all hidden behind goggles, living in their own fantasies.But despite a few pious nods towards the importance of the real world, the film doesn\u2019t seem very interested in the flaws of the OASIS \u2014 or the dark side of the nostalgic fan culture that Wade embodies. Sure, he has a hard time to talking to girls, but it\u2019s clear that when he confronts the film\u2019s villain (a corporate executive who could never love John Hughes movies the way Wade does), we\u2019re meant to see cheer him on as he declares, \u201cA fanboy knows a hater.\u201dAnd while Mark Rylance delivers the film\u2019s most compelling performance as Halliday, the script falls short. By portraying the most powerful technologist in the world as a lonely, awkward but ultimately benign and Willy Wonka-ish figure, it feels strangely out-of-sync with 2018, when everyone seems to be wrestling with the damage that these digital platforms may be doing.And yet \u2026 I had a good time. I felt plenty of reservations as I left the theater, but I made my peace with them\u00a0by accepting\u00a0Ready Player One as the ultimate expression of geek nostalgia, with all the virtues and the limitations that implies.I suspect Spielberg and Cline have taken us as far down the pop culture rabbit hole as any movie can go. Hopefully, other filmmakers will realize that, and they\u2019ll look elsewhere for inspiration.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/ready-player-one-review/"},
{"title": ["Charting the adoption of direct startup investments by family offices"], "text": "There\u2019s money, and then there\u2019s\u00a0wealth. In all likelihood, money is what most of us have (or don\u2019t have). It\u2019s what we use to buy lunch, pay rent or put a down payment on a house. Wealth, on the other hand, is what buys yachts. But more than superficial material things, wealth also buys financial security (and all the good and ill that comes with it) for subsequent generations.Although\u00a0close to half\u00a0of Americans hold no stocks, bonds or real estate, most of the remaining half that are lucky and prosperous enough to do so choose to manage their assets on their own, or perhaps with the help of a financial advisor. But as you move further along the privileged end of the socio-economic curve, managing, preserving and growing one\u2019s wealth becomes more complicated.Many of the world\u2019s highest-net-worth (HNW) families employ an entire office full of accountants, lawyers and investment professionals to manage their assets. These \u201cfamily offices\u201d sometimes manage the assets of more than one family, but they are still relatively close-knit.Historically, family offices haven\u2019t made many direct investments into individual tech startups, instead favoring a more diversified approach to tech investing by being limited partners in venture capital and other private-market funds. Or, outside of tech, they invest in public-market equities, real estate, fixed income or other \u201calternative\u201d asset classes besides VC, PE and hedge funds, according to\u00a0a 2017 article about ultra HNW investors\u2019 portfolios from KKR.Increasingly, however, family offices are investing more into individual tech startups, at least according to anecdotal reports and\u00a0a recent funding round Crunchbase News covered. But one anecdote doesn\u2019t document a trend, so let\u2019s take a look at the numbers.Data covering direct startup investments from\u00a0family offices listed in Crunchbase\u00a0bears out that trend. The chart below is based on more than 1,700 venture deals (seed, angel, equity crowdfunding, Series A, Series B, etc.) struck with individual technology companies by 193 family offices located around the world.The 193 family offices with listed venture investments are, no doubt, only a fraction of the total count of such groups, which tend to be private. Combined with the fact that many startups are slow to announce funding, it\u2019s not like the list of funding rounds or their participants is comprehensive. However, assuming it\u2019s fairly representative, we can treat the figure above as a directional indicator of general trends.And what are those trends?First off, at least when it comes to deal volume, family offices\u2019 startup investment activity tracks with the broader venture investment market (which includes individual angels, venture capital groups, seed funds, accelerators and others).During the several years leading up to 2015, there was a run-up in the number of deals being struck. After that high point, though,\u00a0deal volume began to decline in the U.S., which Crunchbase News\u00a0has documented, as investors\u00a0eschewed writing many smaller checks to early-stage startups, instead favoring fewer, larger checks with later-stage tech companies. On a global scale,\u00a0projected\u00a0deal volume is roughly flat on an annualized basis from 2015 through 2017, whereas\u00a0reported\u00a0deal data is down primarily due to reporting delays. Because there are more U.S. family offices that invest in startups than international ones, it\u2019s not surprising to see that family office deal volume hews closer to the U.S. market in general.But what\u2019s different about family offices \u2014 and what lends credence to the anecdotal evidence suggesting there are more family offices investing in more startups \u2014 is the growth rate in deal volume over time as compared to\u00a0institutional venture capital investors. To be sure, worldwide, there were more deals struck by both types of investor in 2017 than in 2010 (even when accounting for reporting delays). But the difference between these two types of investor is in the magnitude of the change.In the chart below, we compare\u00a0reported\u00a0deal volume between VC funds (which have a lot of known deals per year) and family offices (which, as we showed above, have much fewer recorded startup investment deals per year). We adjust for this discrepancy in deal volume by indexing\u00a0reported\u00a0deal volume against 2010 levels. In doing so, we\u2019re able to deliver a relativistic, apples-to-apples comparison between the two.Worldwide, in 2015,\u00a0reported\u00a0deal volume from VC firms was almost precisely 2.5x that of 2010\u2019s totals. But that multiple for family offices is roughly 6x. And, although it isn\u2019t pictured above, family office deal volume growth outperformed traditional VC between 2011-2017, 2012-2017 and 2013-2017.In relative terms, across a range of measures, deal volume growth was higher and faster among family offices than VC funds for a significant period of time. The data suggest that family offices making direct investments into startups recently became a trend. Especially for that period through 2014, family offices were on the early side of the adoption curve for making direct startup investments. Whatever growth we see on the VC side is the product of growth in the market in general, but it\u2019s not like VC funds are still adopting direct startup investments into their repertoire. It\u2019s been their model for decades. For comparatively stodgy family offices, it was still the new, new thing.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/charting-the-adoption-of-direct-startup-investments-by-family-offices/"},
{"title": ["DARPA wants new ideas for autonomous drone swarms"], "text": "The Defense Department\u2019s research wing is serious about putting drones into action, not just one by one but in coordinated swarms. The Offensive Swarm-Enabled Tactics program is kicking off its second \u201csprint,\u201d a period of solicitation and rapid prototyping of systems based around a central theme. This spring sprint is all about \u201cautonomy.\u201dThe idea is to collect lots of ideas on how new technology, be it sensors, software, or better propeller blades, can enhance the ability of drones to coordinate and operate as a collective.Specifically, swarms of 50 will need to \u201cisolate an urban objective\u201d within half an hour or so by working together with each other and ground-based robot. That at least is the \u201coperational backdrop\u201d that should guide prospective entrants in their decision whether their tech is applicable.So a swarm of drones that seed a field faster than a tractor, while practical for farmers, isn\u2019t really something the Pentagon is interested in here. On the other hand, if you can sell that idea as a swarm of drones dropping autonomous sensors on an urban battlefield, they might take a shine to it.But you could also simply demonstrate how using a compact ground-based lidar system could improve swarm coordination at low cost and without using visible light. Or maybe you\u2019ve designed a midair charging system that lets a swarm perk up flagging units without human intervention.Those are pretty good ideas, actually \u2014 maybe I\u2019ll run them by the program manager, Timothy Chung, when he\u2019s on stage at our Robotics event in Berkeley this May. Chung also oversees the Subterranean Challenge and plenty more at DARPA .

{"title": ["What Apple\u2019s education announcements mean for accessibility"], "text": "From an accessibility news standpoint, this week\u2019s Apple event in Chicago\u00a0was antithetical to the October 2016 event. At the latter event, Apple  began the presentation with a bang \u2014 showing the actual video being edited using Switch Control in Final Cut. Tim Cook came out afterwards to talk some about Apple\u2019s commitment to serving the disabled community before unveiling the then-new accessibility page\u00a0on the company\u2019s website.By contrast, the education-themed event in Chicago  this week went by with barely a mention of accessibility. The only specific call-out came during Greg Joswiak\u2019s time on stage talking about iPad, when he said \u201caccessibility features make iPad a learning tool for everyone.\u201dThat doesn\u2019t mean, however, accessibility has no relevance to what was announced.I was in the audience at Lane Tech College Prep on Tuesday covering the event. As a former special educator\u00a0\u2013and special education student \u2014 I watched with keen interest as Apple told their story around education. While Apple is targeting the mainstream, I came away with strong impressions on how Apple can make serious inroads in furthering special education as well.Apple is obviously\u2014rightfully\u2014building their educational strategy towards mainstream students in mainstream classes. It\u2019s a classic top-down approach: Teachers assign students work via handouts, for such activities as writing essays or completing science projects. This is the entire reason for Apple\u2019s Classroom and Schoolwork apps. However well-designed, they lack an element.Where they lack is there is nothing afforded, at least in specific terms, to teachers and students in special education settings. Apple\u2019s strategy here is defined, again, by the classic teacher-student relationship, without any regard for other models. I\u2019m not levying a criticism on the company; this is the reality.At many levels, special education classrooms do not\u00a0function in a way that\u2019s conducive to Apple\u2019s vision for learning at this time. In the moderate-to-severe early childhood (Pre-K) classrooms I worked in for close to a decade, the structure was such that most, if not all, activities were augmented by a heavy dose of adult support. Furthermore, most of our students were pulled out of class at certain times for additional services such as speech services and physical/occupational therapy sessions.In short, there were no lectures or essay prompts anywhere.This is where accessibility comes in. There is enormous potential for Apple to dig deeper and expand the toolset they offer to educators and students. To accommodate for special education is, in my view, akin to accommodating disabled users by offering accessibility features on each of Apple\u2019s software platforms.Special education is special for a reason. It involves ways of teaching and learning that are unique, and the people who work and learn in these environments deserve the same consideration.Leading up to the event, there was much talk in the Apple community of writers and podcasters that Google  is eating Apple\u2019s lunch in the schools market because Chromebooks are dirt cheap for districts and most everyone relies on Google Docs.I\u2019m not interested in the particulars of this argument. What I am interested in, however, is simply pointing out that despite the perception Apple products are too expensive and less capable, they are better in one meaningful sense: accessibility.Consider Chromebook versus iPad. In many levels of special education, an iPad is far superior to a Chromebook. The tablet\u2019s multi-touch user interface is far more intuitive, and more importantly, iOS is built with accessibility in mind. From VoiceOver to Dynamic Type to Switch Control and more, an iPad (or an iPod Touch, for that matter) can provide a far more accessible and enriching learning experience for many students with disabilities than a Chromebook. And lest we forget the App Store effect; there are many outstanding apps geared for special ed.This is a crucial point that many technology pundits who lament Apple\u2019s position in the education market always seem to miss.One area where Apple can greatly improve the lives of teachers is by broadening the Schoolwork app such that it makes IEP prep easier and, playing to Apple\u2019s core strength, more modern. Historically, even today, IEPs are planned and written using stacks of paperwork. Goals, assessments, and consent forms are handwritten (sometimes typed) and stapled together. And being a binding legal document, teachers must ensure there are the proper signatures on every page, or else be dinged for being out of compliance with protocols. In sum: the IEP is the bane of every special educator\u2019s existence because they take so much time.To this end, Apple could do special education teachers a grand service by adding a module of sorts to its Schoolwork app that would allow them to more easily create and track a student\u2019s IEP. There could be charts for tracking goal progress, as well as ways to collate and distribute documents amongst the IEP team (SLPs, OT/PT, etc) and of course parents. Teachers could even send an email to parents with any consent forms attached and encourage them to sign with Apple Pencil on their iPad, if they have one.At the very least, it would make IEP prep infinitely more efficient, and perhaps alleviate some of the stress at the actual meetings. Digitizing the process would be game-changing, I think.The ideas I\u2019ve outlined here are well within Apple\u2019s wheelhouse. They would likely need to collaborate with special educators and districts on things like IEP forms and policies, but it is certainly within them to do so. They can do this if they want.To reiterate an earlier point, special education deserves just as much thoughtful consideration and innovation as the education industry at large. Given Apple\u2019s unwavering support of accessibility, this is an area in which they can surely improve.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/what-apples-education-announcements-mean-for-accessibility/"},
{"title": ["China\u2019s 9-ton Tiangong-1 space station will burn up tonight, but no one knows quite where"], "text": "What goes up must come down. That\u2019s generally the rule, anyway, certainly for spacecraft that have fulfilled their purpose and have no way to stay in orbit. Such is the case of Tiangong-1, China\u2019s first space station, which after nearly 7 years in space is making an uncontrolled descent and should provide a nice fiery light show in the skies over\u2026 somewhere.Update: Tiangong-1 is no more; it went down over the South Pacific at about 5:16 PM Pacific.Because there are so many unknowns about Tiangong-1\u2019s trajectory, observers can only give an educated guess. The only thing they\u2019re pretty sure about is that it\u2019s going to drop some time in the next 24 hours \u2014 probably sometime tonight, and somewhere between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south.But owing to the speeds involved and the inherently unpredictable nature of how a large body will tumble through the atmosphere, the exact time and location won\u2019t be known basically until the event occurs. \u201cAt no time will a precise time/location prediction from ESA be possible,\u201d explained reentry experts at the European Space Agency.That sounds quite dire, but it isn\u2019t.Sure, Tiangong-1 is about the size of a schoolbus and weighs 9.4 tons, but unlike a meteorite of that size the station is hollow and fragile, and should break apart completely during its descent. There\u2019s no danger, experts insist. No one is on board the station and it isn\u2019t on a collision course with any crewed craft.It may seem a little crazy, but burning up in the atmosphere is just a part of the natural life cycle of large spacecraft. This one isn\u2019t even that big.Tiangong-1 (the name roughly translates to \u201cHeavenly Palace\u201d) was launched in late 2011 in two parts, which connected in space \u2014 the first such feat accomplished by China\u2019s space program. Over the next two years, three spacecraft docked with the newly formed station: one robotic craft, Shenzhou-8, and two crewed missions, Shenzhou-9 and 10, each with three on board.These missions proved the viability of China\u2019s space station tech (another test platform, Tiangong-2, was launched in 2016), and in 2013 Tiangong-1, having accomplished what its creators set out to do, was deactivated. Its creators planned to have it execute a controlled descent at some point, using its thrusters to put it on a path to break up over the ocean.As little risk as there may be of debris hitting someone, it\u2019s good practice not to take that risk if you don\u2019t have to, and good manners not to dispose of your space junk over someone else\u2019s country.Unfortunately, the spacecraft stopped responding to its handlers in China about two years ago, meaning that a controlled descent was no longer possible. As a result, Tiangong-1\u2019s orbit has decayed naturally and it\u2019s only in the last few months that it\u2019s become clear when it would come down.Because we have no telemetry from the station, we only know what we can observe from outside the station (like Fraunhofer\u2019s radar imagery, shown above), and a host of variables make it difficult to say anything with certainty. It wasn\u2019t until this week that its deorbit path has become clear enough that space authorities are confident giving even a 24-hour window when it will come down.Those on the ground there may possibly be treated to a \u201csplendid\u201d light show, as China\u2019s space agency put it, as if a large meteor is breaking up in the upper atmosphere. It should be visible for a minute or so as the station tumbles and breaks up and its constituent pieces burn.Predictions may get slightly better depending on observations, so I\u2019ll update this post if the window is significantly altered.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/chinas-9-ton-tiangong-1-space-station-will-burn-up-tonight-but-no-one-knows-quite-where/"},

Best-known for food deliveries, Ele.me  claims to be China\u2019s biggest online delivery and local services platform. In an announcement, Alibaba said the deal values Ele.me at $9.5 billion. Alibaba, which first invested in Ele.me two years ago, and its affiliate Ant Small and Micro Financial Services Group currently hold about 43% of the company\u2019s outstanding voting shares.This is the latest in a string of investments and acquisitions by Alibaba to expand its physical retail presence as part of its so-called \u201cnew retail\u201d strategy to combine e-commerce and offline retail. The company\u2019s goal is to make it easier for users to move (and spend money) between brick-and-mortar stores and Alibaba businesses like Tmall and Taobao. For example, they may view products at pop-up stores and then order them on their smartphones for almost-immediate home delivery.Ele.me, which will continue to operate under its own brand, is at its heart a logistics technology company. Founded in 2008, it utilizes its logistics system to provide services like Fengniao, an express courier for local deliveries. After the deal is finalized, Alibaba said that founder and chief executive officer Zhang Zhuhao (also known as Mark Zhang) will become chairman of Ele.me and special advisor to Alibaba Group CEO Daniel Zhang on its new retail strategy. Wang Lei, currently vice president of Alibaba Group,  will take over as Ele.me\u2019s CEO.In a press release, Zhang said \u201cUnder the leadership of its founder and management team, Ele.me has achieved leading market share in China\u2019s online food delivery and local services sector. Our shared belief that New Retail will create more value for customers and merchants has brought us together. Looking forward, Ele.me can leverage Alibaba\u2019s infrastructure in commerce and\nfind new synergies with Alibaba\u2019s diverse businesses to add further momentum to the New Retail initiative.\u201dBloomberg reported at the end of February that Alibaba planned to buy the rest of Ele.me\u2019s shares from its other investors, including Baidu.The deal deepens Alibaba\u2019s competition with Tencent, in particular its own local services and delivery platform, Meituan Dianping, which was formed by a merger in 2015. Alibaba previously owned shares in Meituan Dianping, thanks to its investment in Meituan, but began offloading them soon after the merger with Dianping.In a statement, Alibaba said Ele.me complements its affiliate Koubei, a platform that gives restaurants and stores a way to go online and reach more local customers.\u201cBy combining Ele.me\u2019s online home delivery services with Koubei\u2019s consumer acquisition and engagement capability for a range of restaurants and service establishments, Alibaba will be able to offer an integrated\u00a0experiences to customers both online and offline,\u201d said the company.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-01 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/01/alibaba-to-buy-all-remaining-outstanding-shares-of-local-delivery-service-ele-me/"},

Careship  had previously raised \u20ac4 million, disclosed in January 2017.Founded in 2015 by siblings Antonia and Nikolaus Albert after they could not find a suitable caregiver for their grandmother, Careship operates a marketplace for caregivers that aims to disrupt the traditional agency model. The marketplace connects families needing elderly care with access to qualified personnel using a \u201cmatchmaking algorithm\u201d to help solve the suitability problem.There are other value-adds, too, such as advising on insurance benefits. In Germany, elderly care is funded by a state health insurance system and Careship co-founder Antonia Albert tells me the company has a 50/50 mix of state-funded and private customers. \u201cIf you are care dependent in Germany, you are eligible to care and companionship services and get state-funded budgets for them,\u201d she says.

Likewise, Careship handles billing and coordinating insurances, in addition to keeping families connected and therefore remains a central point of contact and is arguably not prone to disintermediation.As it stands, Careship is based in Berlin and the service is also available in three other major German cities as well as the area of North Rhine-Westphalia. Albert tells me the new funding will see the startup add more coverage across Germany in 2018 and that the broader aim is to go international. \u201c[The] long-term vision is to make Careship available to as many families as possible in Europe,\u201d she says.Meanwhile, direct competitors are cited as traditional \u201cambulatory care providers\u201d in Germany as well as other care platforms, such as Rocket Internet\u2019s Pflegetiger, which operates a full stack not marketplace model, and care marketplace Pflegix.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/careship/"},

Last October, the Department of Homeland Security required that all federal agencies update their email policies to comply with the protocol.So far, only seven White House email addresses have taken the basic step of setting up alerts to be notified when their addresses are used in phishing scams, according to the Global Cyber Alliance report. Another 18 haven\u2019t started deploying DMARC.Without DMARC in place, those email addresses can be spoofed by would-be scammers and recipients would have no idea they were receiving a fake email from a government account.\u201cEmail domains managed by the EOP are crown jewels that criminals and foreign adversaries covet,\u201d said Philip Reitinger, president and CEO of the Global Cyber Alliance, in a statement. \u201cThe lack of full DMARC deployment across nearly every EOP email address poses a national security risk that must be fixed. The good news is that four new domains have implemented DMARC at the lowest level, which I hope indicates that DMARC deployment is moving forward.\u201dDomains that have rolled out the lowest settings of DMARC are WhiteHouse.gov and EOP.gov. Other domains under the purview of the EOP include Budget.gov, OMB.gov, USTR.gov, OSTP.gov.These security issues aren\u2019t just academic concerns cooked up by bureaucrats to waste time and add red tape to operations. To see how significant these issues can be, look no further than the Atlanta cyberattack, which happened two weeks ago.The city is still restoring systems after the attack \u2014 a ransomware assault that used SamSam malware to encrypt exposed files. Hackers offered to decrypt the files for a (relatively small) ransom (which it looks like the city has not paid, since systems are still offline).At least Atlanta was able to restore some of its systems (way to back up those files, government officials), but the attack reveals how many critical systems are still vulnerable.Now consider if hackers were using federal government addresses to distribute malware \u2014 that\u2019s a problem everyone should be concerned about.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/white-house-email-domains-are-at-risk-of-being-used-in-phishing-attacks/"},

GIPHY  has apologized, fixed the bug that let the objectionable GIF slip through, and reviewed its GIF sticker library four times in an effort to guarantee that offensive content won\u2019t end up in apps that embed it. Instagram had also removed GIPHY, but reinstated it last week with Snapchat saying it had nothing to share yet.A Snap spokesperson told TechCrunch that over the past several weeks, the Snap team worked with GIPHY to revamp its moderation systems. Now Snap is confident that the fresh approach will protect users, so its brought the GIF stickers back. They let people embellish their photos and videos with overlaid animated illustrations and video clips.So ends a month-long ordeal that started when a U.K. user spotted a GIF containing a racial slur for people of color. Snapchat removed the GIPHY feature as press backlash in the U.K. mounted. Instagram wasn\u2019t aware of the issue until informed by TechCrunch, leading it to remove the GIPHY feature within an hour.Warning: We\u2019ve shared a censored version of the GIF below, but\u00a0it still includes graphic content that may be offensive to some users.The situation highlights the risks of working with outside developers that aren\u2019t entirely under a platform\u2019s control. Piping in external utilities lets apps quickly expand their offering to users. But if developers misuse people\u2019s data, deliver broken functionality, or let objectionable content through, it can reflect poorly on the app hosting them. Facebook is currently dealing with this backlash surrounding Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Instagram  just severely restricted its APIs without warning, breaking many developers\u2019 apps in what\u2019s believed to be part of Facebook\u2019s push to shore up data privacy.Favoring news publishers, Snapchat historically never actively embraced developers, banning use of outside apps that require your Snapchat credentials.

Today, Mayor Bill de Blasio effectively paved the way for bike-sharing startups with pedal-assist functionality to hit the streets in a legal way.\u201cAs cycling continues to grow in popularity for commuting, deliveries and tourism, we are seeing the demand for pedal-assist bicycles that can help cyclists travel longer distances and more easily climb steep hills,\u201d Mayor de Blasio said in a press release. \u201cWith new and clear guidelines, cyclists, delivery workers and businesses alike will now understand exactly what devices are allowed.\u201dThis framework comes several months after Mayor de Blasio cracked down on e-bikes, which led to the NYPD confiscating 923 e-bikes and issuing about 1,800 citations to people who were caught riding them.Before today, it was legal to own an e-bike, but it was technically illegal to operate them.

{"title": ["Selina raises $95M to create a boutique travel lodging experience built around communities"], "text": "If you\u2019re looking to travel abroad \u2014 and especially if you\u2019re looking to work while doing so \u2014 it might be tough to convince yourself you can find a cool boutique hotel that caters to a lot of different price points, as well as surround yourself with people that will help you feel like you should still get your work done.That\u2019s the goal of Selina, an emerging co-working and traveling hospitality service that opens up campuses geared toward fitting those niches across Central America. What started as originally just a real estate company has now turned into a venture-funded startup called Selina,  which goes around the world creating a different kind of hotel product out of renovated older properties. Instead of just renting out a room in an Airbnb or paying for a hotel room in a boutique hotel, or some co-working space, Selina aims to be a more streamlined way to get that mixture of a community experience, a boutique hotel feel, and the ease of getting a consistent experience across multiple different properties. The company said today it\u2019s raised $95 million from\u00a0Abraaj Group and WeWork founder Adam Neumann.\u201cThere are lifestyle hotels, surf camps, co-working places, hostels, and all those kinds of properties, Yoav Gery, Selina\u2019s president, said. \u201cA lot of companies talk the same talk. What was different about us and what we were telling the world is we were doing something different in the hospitality world. We\u2019re creating a much more holistic program for the traveler. It\u2019s not just a hotel, or for co-working. It\u2019s everything that the traveler would want. And we hope the speed at which we\u2019re doing it is also unique. Most hotels couldn\u2019t get a product and convert it in 3 or 4 months into a new brand.\u201dYou can think of Selina almost as a kind of ramped-up hostel \u2014 where you\u2019re getting people of all different backgrounds into one spot to meet each other and get a feel for the area. But Selina still does serve different price points, from the bunk room set-up at a common hostel for under $30 a night to a more traditional private room that you\u2019d find in an Airbnb  or hotel for a higher price. The whole point, Gery said, is that customers shouldn\u2019t be spending most of their time in their rooms.The company currently has 22 locations that range a variety of locales, whether that\u2019s beach areas or metropolitan ones. It plans to open a new location in Miami this year as it starts to expand beyond Central America, looking to structure it around frequent travelers looking to meet other like-minded individuals that might be looking to either explore a new area or find a co-working spot while traveling.Selina started in Central America and has since begun expanding throughout those countries, and the company hopes to begin expanding into the United States and Europe this year as it continues to make inroads into Latin America. Selina looks to hire people that have the specific experience working with those regions when it comes to taxes and regulations, and one of the benefits it has is that it is usually repurposing old real estate. That means, in theory, most things should already be up to code for a hospitality project, Gery said.\u201cWe are the first company to capitalize on this lifestyle shift for travelers and the way people are working,\u201d Selina VP of strategy Brynne McNulty Rojas said. \u201cPeople are eager to see the way we\u2019re offering all these different business lines to make people feel at home, whether or not they\u2019re on vacation or working. We do the market research, and exactly the target beds we want, that\u2019s what gave people comfort \u2014 that we were going to be able to achieve the scale we were projecting. We wanted to focus on having\u00a0that Selina DNA and that simplicity of experience and transactions and making it a nice, tech-first way of traveling and living and working.\u201dPart of the process is finding those old areas to renovate, but Selina hopes to also build out a strategy where it knows the exact needs for each of those properties \u2014 and how to properly staff them. The company hopes to be able to operate efficiently with a hospitality staff of between 30 or 40, though that could vary from property to property depending on the location. After all, an experience in Brooklyn is probably going to look radically different from one on the coast of Belize.Then there\u2019s the data aspect of it, where Selina is able \u2014 like any emerging hospitality service such as Airbnb, for example \u2014 to collect the right information from potential customers. But while Airbnb might be centered around that individual experience, Rojas said it wants to use data from potential visitors to improve the more community-oriented experience at Selina. In the end, it\u2019s about having that campus-oriented feel to it rather than just renting someone\u2019s home on the beach, she said.The challenge, of course, is going to be going up against emerging hospitality services \u2014 like Airbnb, of course, which could work with a host to create a similar experience through a platform-oriented approach. But the company hopes it\u2019ll have that vibe of a unified hotel chain experience in addition to being able to scale it up at the rate of a startup and be able to show investors that its ability to rapidly create new properties is what will make it be successful.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/selina-raises-95m-to-create-a-boutique-travel-lodging-experience-built-around-communities/"},
{"title": ["Facebook plans to let everyone unsend messages, will stop Zuckerberg until then"], "text": "TechCrunch reported last night that Facebook retracted Facebook messages sent by Mark Zuckerberg and other executives from their recipients\u2019 inboxes. That\u2019s an ability normal Facebook  users don\u2019t have. But now Facebook tells me it plans to make an \u201cunsend\u201d feature available to all users in several months, and has already been considering how to build this product. Until the Unsend feature is released for everyone, Facebook says it won\u2019t unsend or retract any more of Zuckerberg\u2019s messages.The retractions of the CEO\u2019s chats were never previously disclosed until Facebook confirmed the news to TechCrunch last night after we reported having email receipt evidence of messages that have since disappeared. Many users are seeing that as a breach of trust.Revealing plans for the Unsend button now could serve to dampen the backlash by making Zuckerberg look like a beta tester of the feature, and eventually normalizing Unsend as a common behavior.For the full story on Zuckerberg\u2019s disappearing messages, check out our feature story:Update: A Facebook spokesperson issued this statement apologizing for not offering Unsend to everyone sooner and explaining its plans:\u201cWe have discussed this feature several times. And people using our secret message feature in the encrypted version of Messenger have the ability to set a timer \u2014 and have their messages automatically deleted. We will now be making a broader delete message feature available. This may take some time. And until this feature is ready, we will no longer be deleting any executives\u2019 messages. We should have done this sooner \u2014 and we\u2019re sorry that we did not.\u201dTo recap, now six sources confirm that Facebook messages they had received from Mark Zuckerberg had disappeared from their inboxes. When we told Facebook we had an email receipt proving the retractions, Facebook gave TechCrunch this statement: \u201cAfter Sony Pictures\u2019 emails were hacked in 2014 we made a number of changes to protect our executives\u2019 communications. These included limiting the retention period for Mark\u2019s messages in Messenger. We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.\u201dBut tampering with users\u2019 inboxes without disclosure has struck many users as a violation of Facebook\u2019s power. Many asked why Zuckerberg and other executives had access to functionality not offered to regular users.Facebook tells TechCrunch is hasn\u2019t finalized exactly how the Unsend feature will work. A Facebook Messenger spokesperson tells me the only possible option is an expiration timer users can set on messages. When the timer runs out, the message would disappear from both their and the recipients\u2019 inboxes. They tell me this is similar to how retractions of Zuckerberg\u2019s messages work.Facebook already offers a \u201cSecret\u201d encrypted messaging feature that includes an Unsend expiration timer. But this can\u2019t be used in existing traditional Facebook message threads, and instead users have to launch a separate \u201cSecret\u201d conversation. Zuckerberg and other executives weren\u2019t using this feature, and instead had their permanent, non-\u201cSecret\u201d messages retracted. Instagram also offers an Unsend option in its Direct messaging feature, but warns that while it can retract sent messages, the recipient may have already read them.But in the coming months, Facebook will bring either this expiration timer or another way to Unsend messages to all Messenger threads. Facebook didn\u2019t have details about whether recipients would be notified when a message was unsent and retracted from their inboxes, whether the feature would apply retroactively to old messages sent before the launch or whether users would need to designate a message as expiring/unsendable before they send it.Beyond the dubious ethics of Facebook manipulating users\u2019 private messaging threads without consent or disclosure, there\u2019s the question of whether and unsend feature is good for Facebook at all. It could make users more willing to share vulnerable, sensitive or confidential professional messages. But it also might make users paranoid that messages they receive could disappear, leading to anxious screenshotting. It also could lead to abuse if users think they can send offensive content then have it retracted shortly after it\u2019s seen.Facebook could have announced plans for the Unsend feature at any time. It could have disclosed the retractions of Zuckerberg\u2019s messages at any time. But waiting until it was confronted with evidence of the deletions and public backlash shows Facebook is only being transparent with users when forced.If you have more info on this situation, including evidence of messages from other Facebook executives disappearing, please contact this article\u2019s author, Josh Constine, via open Twitter DMs, josh@techcrunch.com or encrypted Signal chat at (585)750-5674.For more on Facebook\u2019s recent struggles, read our feature pieces:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-unsend-messages/"},

With the rise of meal kit services, like Blue Apron, consumers have less need to visit grocery stores to purchase their recipe ingredients. In addition, many grocers are reacting to the threat posed by Amazon\u2019s purchase of Whole Foods, which allows it to offer pickup and delivery, as well as traditional grocery shopping.Plated is not the first meal kit to find its way to stores. Kroger also entered the meal kit business last year, and Blue Apron in March announced plans to start selling its kits in stores, too, as did Weight Watchers.\u00a0Amazon\u00a0has been selling meal kits on its site, and Walmart just launched its own meal kits and other quick dinner options, too. Walmart says these kits will reach 2,000 stores by year-end.Albertsons says the meal kits will continue to roll out across the U.S. in the months ahead.

A half-dozen of Plated\u2019s most popular kits will be available for sale, including:This is a small selection, given Plated to date has created 2,200 recipes. However, Albertsons says the meal choices will rotate seasonally to offer variety, and the in-store kits will always include recipes with beef, chicken, seafood and vegetarian options.With so many meal kits available today for home delivery and, increasingly, in stores,\u00a0Albertsons hopes to differentiate itself on taste and quality.

And with the option to take delivery when you choose, or grab a kit at a store, Albertsons\u2019 meal kits could appeal to a broader market than meal kit subscriptions do which are often pricy and require an ongoing commitment.\u201cThis is the next big step in our journey to enable everyone to enjoy fresh, delicious meals.

Today we\u2019re announcing that in addition to our subscription offering, customers near hundreds of\u00a0Albertsons Companies stores will be able to pick up last-minute or order online for on demand delivery.\u201dWhile Albertsons\u2019 acquisition of a meal kit startup was a first for a national grocery chain, it\u2019s becoming clear that meal kit options are becoming a baseline for grocery competitors across the board as they prepare to battle with the likes of Amazon and Walmart, Blue Apron and more.Image credits: Albertsons", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/albertsons-will-offer-plateds-meal-kits-across-hundreds-of-stores-this-year/"},
{"title": ["The high-stakes battle for the Pentagon\u2019s winner-take-all cloud contract"], "text": "There is a battle afoot, one you might not have heard about yet, but it involves a high-stakes winner-take-all contract for the Department of Defense\u2019s cloud contract. It could involve billions of dollars and when a humongous sum of money meets a set of powerful tech companies, intrigue can\u2019t be far behind.The story even has a Star Wars reference\u00a0with the Pentagon dubbing the project the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (or JEDI for short). Who says the Pentagon is staid?The tech names involved include the likes of Amazon,  Google, Microsoft, Oracle and Rean Cloud, LLC. Wait, what\u2019s that last one doing there you may ask? Good questions, but Rean Cloud, a little known Maryland Amazon Web Services partner was awarded a five-year contract worth up to $950 million in February to help the DoD with cloud procurement and pricing, likely a first step ahead of the cloud contract itself.It didn\u2019t take long for the big guys to start howling and Oracle  (you will hear that name more than once in this story), filed a formal complaint over the deal with Government Accountability Office. Not long after, the DoD announced that the deal was being scaled back from $950 million to $65 million, still a substantial contract for a systems integrator you probably never heard of, but a fraction of the original deal.A couple of days later, the Pentagon announced it was starting a bidding process for the cloud contract itself. That would be a winner-take-all affair for a contract that could stretch for a decade and involve many billions of dollars. The exact number isn\u2019t clear, but suffice to say it\u2019s a humongous sum and every enterprise cloud company wants this deal.As you might expect with a huge deal in Washington, DC, it didn\u2019t take long for politics to enter into the fray. For starters, the Congress began to question the single winner component. They included language in the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill directing the DoD to explain within 60 days how it plans to acquire cloud services in light of the parameters of its cloud bidding process. In particular, Congress was concerned about the Pentagon being locked into a single vendor for a decade with no real way to back out and no competition after the initial bidding process.Next, the president began a series of Tweets against Amazon, not necessarily related to the cloud or the Pentagon contract, but Amazon is the biggest cloud company bidding for a major contract. It\u2019s worth noting that White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied the president\u2019s anti-Amazon stance would play a role in the contract award.Perhaps not, but Bloomberg reported that Oracle co-CEO Safra Catz met with the president this week and reportedly criticized the bidding process (again), which could favor Amazon. If you\u2019re wondering why rivals like Oracle and others are concerned, they probably have reason to be. Oracle came very late to the cloud game and is playing catch-up. Certainly a contract of this size could go a long way towards giving the company a huge market share and credibility lift.Amazon is the market leader by far with estimates running between 30 and 40 percent of cloud infrastructure as a service marketshare. In a report on fourth quarter cloud revenue, Synergy Research wrote, \u201cAWS maintained its dominant position with revenues that exceeded the next four closest competitors combined, despite huge strides being made by Microsoft .\u201dAmazon has more than a marketshare advantage, it also has experience implementing large cloud projects for the intelligence community including a $600 million private cloud it built for the CIA in 2013. Of course, Microsoft already has a $927 million contract with the DoD, so this isn\u2019t necessarily a slam dunk for AWS.With so much drama involved in the size and scope of the project, the president\u2019s anti-Amazon tweets, Congress\u2019s concerns; chances are nobody will be happy with the results except the bid winner. Stay tuned because this isn\u2019t over by a long shot.We reached out to Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle for comments on this story, but did not hear back by publication. If we hear from them, we will update the story with comments.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/the-high-stakes-battle-for-the-pentagons-winner-take-all-cloud-contract/"},

Zero-fee trading of Bitcoin and Ethereum is now available to all investors in California, Massachusetts, Missouri, and Montana. Everyone else is still on the waitlist.\u00a0Robinhood users everywhere can already track 16 crypto coins including BTC, ETH, Litecoin, and Ripple, as well as trade traditional stocks with no transaction commission.Announced in January, Robinhood Crypto vastly undercuts Coinbase\u2019s U.S. fees that range from 1.5 to 4 percent. One million users waitlisted for Robinhood Crypto in the first 5 days after it was announced, and the app now has four million total registered users. Its lack of fees is proving to be a way to lure both veteran and rookie crypto investors to Robinhood, though it lacks support for trading as wide of a range of coins as Coinbase. Rather than charging per trade, Robinhood earns money from interest on money in users\u2019 accounts and its Robinhood Gold subscription service. For for $6 to $200 a month in subscription fees, users can borrow between $1,000 and $50,000 to trade with.Robinhood Gold\u2019s success, adding options and web trading, and the new Robinhood Crypto helped the startup attract a $350 million Series D round led by Russian fund DST Global, which a source confirms will value it at $5.6 billion and bring it to $526 million in total funding. That\u2019s up from the\u00a0$110 million Series C\u00a0at a $1.3 billion valuation it raised last year.That massive valuation will put a ton of pressure on Robinhood\u2019s co-CEOs Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt to keep it growing, build out its subscription and interest revenue, and invade the space of competitors. [Disclosure: I know the founders from college] Those include traditional brokers like Scottrade and E*Trade that can charge $7 or more per trade, crypto-specific exchanges like Coinbase, and news sources like CoinDesk.Robinhood risks a down round if the heightened societal and regulatory skepticism about cryptocurrencies curtail investments from the public. Robinhood\u2019s historical focus on younger, less wealthy investors who aren\u2019t \u201caccredited\u201d could make it especially vulnerable to crypto backlash if users see the space as too volatile or scammy for amateur investors to join. There are also heightened cybersecurity concerns, as users might bail on the app if they fear their cryptocurrency could be stolen.Robinhood might do well to get more serious about how it offers crypto education. It\u2019s promised to provide a feed of crypto news to keep people informed about why markets are moving, though it\u2019s still in testing with a small number of users right now. The problem is that the\u00a0crypto journalism space is rife with integrity violations and reporters with questionable expertise. If Robinhood bought or built a truly neutral crypto news source, it could use that to attract investors to its crypto trading platform.[Disclosre: The author of this article owns small positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum but does not day trade.

HP\u2019s\u00a0Envy ISS, a printer designed for the extremely narrow use case of zero gravity, is hitching a ride on today\u2019s SpaceX CSR-14 rocket launch. The printer, which is based on the company\u2019s regular-gravity OfficeJet 5740 is (as its name implies) destined for the International Space Station, which for all of its high technology, apparently has yet to go full paper-free. According to HP, the ISS team goes through around two reams of paper in a given month. Those documents are used for such mission critical texts as timelines and inventory, along with personal items like letters and photos from home. Until now, the team has been reliant on nearly two-decade-old devices. Not exactly the sort of cutting-edge tech one would expect \u2014 or hope for \u2014 in space station equipment.There are, naturally, a number of different issues one must plan for when building a printer for space. Those include, but are not limited to, managing paper and waste ink in zero-G, making fully flat retardant plastics and printing in a whole bunch of different orientations. These largely aren\u2019t the sort of things that will make HP printers that much better for the rest of us earthlings in the short-term, but the project is probably worth it for the publicity alone. After all, the company has already started deploying its ZBook laptop to mission operations. That number should total 120 by the time it\u2019s done.

For the longest time, Google\u2019s Chrome Web Store allowed for single-purpose mining extensions. That is, developers could publish extensions in the store that clearly stated their purpose and that had no other purpose than to mine.As it turns out, 90 percent of extensions that mine crypto don\u2019t comply with those rules. The lure of cheap Monero is simply too great for some developers, so they try to smuggle their mining scripts into what look like legitimate extensions. Some of those get detected and removed outright and some actually make it into the store and have to be removed. Google is obviously not happy with that, as it\u2019s not a great user experience. Those extensions tend to use a good amount of processing power, after all.So starting today, Google won\u2019t allow into the Chrome Web Store any extension that mines cryptocurrencies, and starting in late June, all of the existing extensions will be removed.\u00a0It\u2019s worth noting that Google will still allow for blockchain-related extensions that don\u2019t mine.\u201cThe extensions platform provides powerful capabilities that have enabled our developer community to build a vibrant catalog of extensions that help users get the most out of Chrome,\u201d writes James Wagner, Google\u2019s product manager for its extensions platform. \u201cUnfortunately, these same capabilities have attracted malicious software developers who attempt to abuse the platform at the expense of users.

{"title": ["Apple, in a very Apple move, is reportedly working on its own Mac chips"], "text": "Apple  is planning to use its own chips for its Mac devices, which could replace the Intel chips currently running on its desktop and laptop hardware, according to a report from Bloomberg.Apple already designs a lot of custom silicon, including its chipsets like the W-series for its Bluetooth headphones, the S-series in its watches, its A-series iPhone chips, as well as customized GPU for the new iPhones. In that sense, Apple has in a lot of ways built its own internal fabless chip firm, which makes sense as it looks for its devices to tackle more and more specific use cases and remove some of its reliance on third parties for their equipment. Apple is already in the middle of in a very public spat with Qualcomm over royalties, and while the Mac is sort of a tertiary product in its lineup, it still contributes a significant portion of revenue to the company.Creating an entire suite of custom silicon could do a lot of things for Apple, the least of which bringing in the Mac into a system where the devices can talk to each other more efficiently. Apple already has a lot of tools to shift user activities between all its devices, but making that more seamless means it\u2019s easier to lock users into the Apple ecosystem. If you\u2019ve ever compared connecting headphones with a W1 chip to the iPhone and just typical Bluetooth headphones, you\u2019ve probably seen the difference, and that could be even more robust with its own chipset. Bloomberg reports that Apple may implement the chips as soon as 2020.Intel  may be the clear loser here, and the market is reflecting that. Intel\u2019s stock is down nearly 8% after the report came out, as it would be a clear shift away from the company\u2019s typical architecture where it has long held its ground as Apple moves on from traditional silicon to its own custom designs. Apple, too, is not the only company looking to design its own silicon, with Amazon  looking into building its own AI chips for Alexa in another move to create a lock-in for the Amazon ecosystem.

{"title": ["Grindr sends HIV status to third parties, and some personal data unencrypted"], "text": "Hot on the heels of last week\u2019s security issues, dating app Grindr  is under fire again for inappropriate sharing of HIV status with third parties (not advertisers, as I had written here before) and inadequate security on other personal data transmission. It\u2019s not a good look for a company that says privacy is paramount.Norwegian research outfit SINTEF analyzed the app\u2019s traffic and found that HIV status, which users can choose to include in their profile, is included in packets sent to Apptimize and Localytics. Users are not informed that this data is being sent.These aren\u2019t advertising companies but rather services for testing and improving mobile apps \u2014 Grindr isn\u2019t selling them this data or anything. The company\u2019s CTO told BuzzFeed News that \u201cthe limited information shared with these platforms is done under strict contractual terms that provide for the highest level of confidentiality, data security, and user privacy.\u201d And to the best of my knowledge regulations like HIPAA don\u2019t prevent the company from transmitting medical data provided voluntarily by users to third parties as specified in the privacy policy.That said, it\u2019s a rather serious breach of trust that something as private as HIV status is being shared in this way, even if it isn\u2019t being done with any kind of ill intention. The laxity with which this extremely important and private information is handled undermines the message of care and consent that Grindr is careful to cultivate.Update: Grindr\u2019s head of security told Axios that the company will stop sending HIV status data to third parties.Perhaps more serious from a systematic standpoint, however, is the unencrypted transmission of a great deal of sensitive data.The SINTEF researchers found that precise GPS position, gender, age, \u201ctribe\u201d (e.g. bear, daddy), intention (e.g. friends, relationship), ethnicity, relationship status, language and device characteristics are sent over HTTP to a variety of advertising companies. A Grindr representative confirmed that location, age, and tribe are \u201csometimes\u201d sent unencrypted. I\u2019ve asked for clarification on this.Not only is this extremely poor security practice, but Grindr appears to have been caught in a lie. The company told me last week when news of another security issue arose that \u201call information transmitted between a user\u2019s device and our servers is encrypted and communicated in a way that does not reveal your specific location to unknown third parties.\u201dAt the time I asked them about accusations that the app sent some data unencrypted; I never heard back. Fortunately for users, though unfortunately for Grindr, my question was answered by an independent body, and the above statement is evidently false.It would be one thing to merely share this data with advertisers and other third parties \u2014 although it isn\u2019t something many users would choose, presumably they at least consent to it as part of signing up.But to send this information in the clear presents a material danger to the many gay people around the world who cannot openly identify as such. The details sent unencrypted are potentially enough to identify someone in, say, a coffee shop \u2014 and anyone in that coffee shop with a bit of technical knowledge could be monitoring for exactly those details. Identifying incriminating traffic in logs also could be done at the behest of one of the many governments that have outlawed homosexuality.I\u2019ve reached out to Grindr for comment and expect a statement soon; I\u2019ll update this post as soon as I receive it.Update: Here is Grindr\u2019s full statement on the sharing of HIV data; notably it does not address the unencrypted transmission of other data.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/grindr-sends-hiv-status-to-third-parties-and-some-personal-data-unencrypted/"},
{"title": ["Markets drop sharply as China implements new tariffs against US"], "text": "Who would have thought a potential trade war would cause investors to sell?U.S. markets plunged today as China announced that it was implementing tariffs on $3 billion worth of American goods, mostly in agriculture and steel production. The Dow was down nearly 600 points today an hour before markets closed, and the NASDAQ was down about 210 points, or roughly 2.92 percent.Investors are skittish that a festering trade skirmish will grow into a full-on trade war. Even though these Chinese tariffs weren\u2019t directed at high-tech goods, investors expect that any trade fight will ultimately hit the sector the hardest, as\u00a0American exports to China are predominantly in areas like aircraft, machinery and electronics. Tech stocks were almost universally down today except for a handful of smaller players.China\u2019s proposed tariffs are 15 percent on 120 categories of goods, including dried apples, frozen strawberries, unshelled chestnuts, sparkling wine and various types of stainless steel piping and casings. The Chinese are going to levy a higher 25 percent tariff on pork products and aluminum scrap coming from the United States. The tariffs were implemented today, and are retaliation to the Trump administration\u2019s announcement that it would place tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. China has not yet responded with a retaliatory tariff for Trump\u2019s tariff on $60 billion of electronic goods, which has not yet been brought into force.Increasing tariffs is an unusual event in a world that has made free trade agreements a major force for diplomacy over the past three decades. China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but market liberalization has lagged, and there are increasing constituencies in the United States and in other Western nations to reverse these trade agreements and cut a new deal.Much as the United States is preparing a fusillade of techniques to slow down Chinese trade, the Chinese government is also attempting to use various powers to fight back. Qualcomm is still waiting for approval from China\u2019s government for its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors, a massive deal at the heart of one of America\u2019s most prominent technology leaders. China is also considering creating Chinese Depositary Receipts to mobilize local dollars and \u201cbuy back\u201d local tech behemoths like Alibaba and Tencent, potentially creating a new trillion-dollar local asset market.On the American side, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was quoted last week saying that a computer algorithm would try to select goods that maximize the harm to China\u2019s trade, while minimizing the damage to American consumers. That\u2019s gradient descent into trade oblivion.It\u2019s a multidimensional game, with both sides using tactics that would have been completely dismissed by policymakers just a year or two ago.

Today, the California Department of Motor Vehicles adopted new regulations pertaining to autonomous vehicles.\u201cState law requires the California DMV  to develop regulations for the safe testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads,\u201d a DMV spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. \u201cWith the adoption of regulations effective\u00a0April 2, 2018, the DMV has the authority to issue permits for driverless testing or deployment of autonomous vehicles.\u00a0When an application is received, it will be thoroughly reviewed. The Department will not approve any permits until it is clear that the applicant has met all of the safe operation requirements set forth in law and in the regulations.\u201dWhat\u2019s new is that the DMV now has three autonomous vehicle permit options: testing with a driver, driverless testing and deployment. Most of the new elements of the regulations are around driverless testing and deployment.For example, in order to conduct driverless testing, companies must have previously tested the vehicles in controlled conditions. The vehicles must also, among many other things, meet the definition of an SAE Level 4 or 5 vehicle.\u00a0With deployment, companies need to ensure cars can detect and respond to roadway situations, meet best practices to detect cyberattacks and more.What many people have their eyes on pertain to operating autonomous vehicles without a safety driver, as well as deploying self-driving cars for public use. To date, no company has applied for a deployment permit and just one company has applied for a permit to test fully autonomous cars, the DMV spokesperson told TechCrunch. The DMV has 10 days to let the applicant know if it\u2019s complete.\u201cIf it is deemed complete the application will be thoroughly reviewed,\u201d the spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cThere is not a timeline on when the DMV approves a permit after receiving a complete application.\u201dThe DMV did not disclose which company applied for driverless testing, but it\u2019s definitely not Uber.

For the most part, the left that role to others in the company.The current head of the Google Brain project,\u00a0Jeff Dean, who joined Google back in 1999, will take Giannandrea\u2019s role in Google\u2019s AI group, and Ben Gomes, the company\u2019s current VP of search engineering, will become the company\u2019s new search chief.Overall, this is a bit of a curious turn of events, but it does make sense to bring the Google Brain project and the company\u2019s other AI initiatives under a single umbrella.As he told me at our Disrupt event in San Francisco last year, his view of AI is pretty practical and, while he acknowledge the need for ethics to inform AI research and products, he definitely isn\u2019t worried about the AI apocalypse.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m definitely not worried about the AI apocalypse,\u201d he said. \u201cI just object to the hype and soundbites that some people are making.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/google-ai-and-search-chief-john-giannandrea-steps-down/"},
{"title": ["Instagram suddenly chokes off developers as Facebook chases privacy"], "text": "Without warning, Instagram  has broken many of the unofficial apps built on its platform. This weekend it surprised developers with a massive reduction in how much data they can pull from the Instagram API, shrinking the API limit from 5,000 to 200 calls per user per hour. Apps that help people figure out if their followers follow them back or interact with them, analyze their audiences or find relevant hashtags are now quickly running into their API limits, leading to broken functionality and pissed off users.Two sources confirmed the new limits to TechCrunch, and developers are complaining about the situation on StackOverflow.In a puzzling move, Instagram is refusing to comment on what\u2019s happening while its developer rate limits documentation site\u00a0404s. All it would confirm is that Instagram has stopped accepting submissions of new apps, just as Facebook announced it would last week following backlash over Cambridge Analytica. Developers tell me they feel left in the dark and angry that the change wasn\u2019t scheduled or even officially announced, preventing them from rebuilding their apps to require fewer API calls.Some developers suspect the change is part of Instagram parent company Facebook\u2019s  scramble to improve data privacy in the wake of its non-stop string of data scandals. In the past week, Facebook announced it was shutting down Partner Categories ad targeting based on third-party data brokers. TechCrunch reported that Facebook also plans to require businesses to pledge that they have consumers\u2019 consent to attain their email addresses, which they use for ad targeting through Custom Audiences.Most public backlash has focused on #DeleteFacebook and ignored its subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp. But Instagram may hope to prevent the virus of distrust from infecting its app too by cutting the API call limit to 1/25th of its previous volume.Causing this kind of platform whiplash could push developers away from the Instagram ecosystem, not that the company was too keen on some of these apps. For example, Reports+ charges $3.99 per month to give people analytics about their Instagram followers. Sensor Tower tells TechCrunch that Reports+ has grossed more than $18 million worldwide since October 2016 on the App Store and Google Play, and made more than $1.2 million last month alone.Instagram might have understandably seen these apps as parasitic, charging users for unofficial functionality or encouraging audience growth hacking that can lead to spam. In January, Instagram announced it would shut down the old API over the next two years, starting with removing the ability to pull a user\u2019s follower list and follow/unfollow people on their behalf on July 31st. Instagram has been slowly trying to clean up its platform for years, having previously threatened legal actions against derivative apps with \u201cInsta\u201d or \u201cGram\u201d in their names in 2013, and shut down its feed API\u00a0in 2015 that allowed for unofficial Instagram feed-reading apps.Instagram is now pushing developers on a much more restrictive platform that only lets approved partners post at users\u2019 behest, and that can only pull mentions of and analytics about business accounts.\u00a0These changes were slated to kill many of the apps broken by this weekend\u2019s API limit reductions.But at least developers were given fair warning about the July 31st deadline. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that Facebook put a pause on reviewing any new applications last Monday as it tries to shore up data privacy safeguards in the wake of Cambridge Analytica . Instagram confirms to TechCrunch that the moratorium on app submissions extends to Instagram\u2019s new Graph API, but wouldn\u2019t explain anything about the API limits. So Instagram is breaking old apps while not allowing developers to submit new, compliant ones.\u201cInstagram\u2019s lack of communication is frustrating to me because now I\u2019m scrambling to update my apps and dealing with loads of unhappy customers,\u201d a developer told me on the condition of anonymity. \u201cIf I had had a month to prep for this, I could\u2019ve tweaked things so that limit was harder to reach. I\u2019d be more frugal with my requests. What happened is all of a sudden, I\u2019m getting dozens of emails, DMs on Instagram, with people saying the app\u2019s not working.\u201dWhile Facebook is wise to scrutinize apps pulling in lots of user data, doing so without warning or even an announcement is how Facebook hurt its relationships with developers circa 2009 as it tried to rapidly reign in spammy virality. Facebook is enduring a crisis of conscience regarding whether its apps can be misused as weapons by those trying to interfere with elections or just exploit our data for profit.But as the owner of some of the world\u2019s most popular developer platforms, it\u2019s worrying to see it flail and thrash this way. If Facebook and Instagram can\u2019t even communicate changes to its policies with proper procedure and transparency, it\u2019s hard to imagine it\u2019s composed enough to firmly and fairly enforce them.For more on Facebook and Instagram\u2019s troubles, check out our feature pieces:\u00a0", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit/"},
{"title": ["Self-care apps are booming"], "text": "Millennials may be a bit obsessed with self-care\u00a0\u2014 and it\u2019s beginning to pay off for the makers of self-care and digital wellness apps. According to data from multiple app store intelligence firms, the category is now seeing notable growth. In the first quarter of 2018, the top 10 grossing self-care apps in the U.S. earned $15 million in combined iOS and Android revenue, and $27 million in worldwide revenue, according to Sensor Tower.The firm also found that the top 10 wellness apps (e.g. mindfulness and meditation) made about 170 percent more revenue worldwide in Q1 2018 than the top 10 wellness apps did in Q1 2017 across both the App Store and Google Play. In the U.S., they made about 167 percent more.However, a big chunk of self-care apps\u2019 revenue is being claimed by just two apps \u2014 Calm and Headspace, both of which focus on mindfulness and meditation. Calm, the top grosser, earned about half the total revenue in the U.S. and worldwide, equating to roughly $8 million in the U.S. and $13.5 million worldwide. Combined with Headspace, the two generated more than 90 percent of the top 10 apps\u2019 revenue last quarter.Apptopia  is also reporting a surge in self-care app revenues and installs, but its numbers don\u2019t agree with Sensor Tower data.Both firms agreed on the top three, however: Calm, followed by Headspace, then 10% Happier: Meditation Daily. Other mindfulness apps appeared on both charts, including The Mindfulness App and Stop, Breathe & Think.The discrepancies may be attributed to how the companies define \u201cself-care\u201d \u2014 as it\u2019s not a specific app store category \u2014 as well as data quality.Apptopia also claimed self-care app installs are up year-over-year, with more new self-care apps arriving every year.Regardless of which firm is closer to actual, the trend is clear: self-care app adoption is booming.\u00a0Apple, for example, pegged self-care as one of its top four breakout trends for 2017, saying \u201cnever before have we seen such a surge in apps focused specifically on mental health, mindfulness and stress reduction.\u201dAs to why self-care apps are the latest craze, that\u2019s a bit more complicated.Some experts say millennials\u2019 use of the informational resources on the internet increased awareness about self-care in general; others would say the always-on news cycle of the web combined with the depressing nature of social media led to a growing need for self-care tools. And, of course, cynics would argue it\u2019s simply because millennials are more self-absorbed than other generations, and this trendy focus on self-care is the proof.But there are plenty of other factors beyond that. Millennials married later\u00a0and\u00a0were slower to buy homes as a result \u2014 that may have led them to have more time to remained self-focused, as they may not have had the same set of distracting responsibilities as their parents. (Or the related drains on their extraneous funds!)Meanwhile, the stigma around mental illness is also on the decline, which aids a self-care app surge.However, not all self-care apps are a replacement for traditional mental health care, when it comes to more serious matters. Some of the talk therapy apps were found to be ineffective, expensive, inconsistent in the quality of care provided and, at worst, potentially dangerous.For those problems that can\u2019t be meditated away, please still call a doctor or an emergency hotline.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/self-care-apps-are-booming/"},
{"title": ["Skydio R1 review: a mesmerizing, super-expensive self-flying drone"], "text": "The idea of a robot methodically hunting you down isn\u2019t the most pleasant of concepts. A metal-bodied being zooming after you at up to 25 miles per hour with multiple eyes fixed on your location seems\u2026 out of your best interest.The Skydio R1 drone seems friendly enough. though. I wouldn\u2019t call it loving or cute by any means, but it really just wants to keep up with you and ensure it captures your great life moments with its big blue eye.What makes the $2,499 Skydio  R1 special is that it doesn\u2019t need a pilot \u2014 it flies itself. The drone uses 12 of its 13 on-board cameras to rapidly map the environment around it, sensing obstacles and people as it quickly plans and readjusts its flight paths. That means you can launch the thing and go for a walk. You can launch the thing and explore nature. You can launch the thing and go biking and the R1 will follow you with ease, never losing sight of you as it tries to keep up with you and capture the perfect shots in 4K.That was the company\u2019s sell anyway; I got my hand on one a few weeks ago to test it myself and have been zipping it around the greater West coast annoying and impressing many with what I\u2019ve come to the conclusion is clearly the smartest drone on the planet.The R1 has a number of autonomous modes to track users as it zips around. Not only can the drone follow you, it also can predict your path and wander in front of you. It can orbit around you as you move or follow along from the side. You can do all this by just tapping a mode, launching the drone and moving along. There are options for manual controls if you desire, but the R1 eschews the bulky drone controller for a simple, single-handed control system on the Skydio app on your phone.The app is incredibly simple and offers a wide range of tracking modes that are pretty breezy to swipe through. Setting the drone up for the first flight was as simple as connecting to the drone via password and gliding through a couple of minutes of instructional content in the app. You can launch it off the ground or from your hand; I opted for the hand launch most times, which powers up the propellers until it\u2019s tugging away from you, flying out a couple of meters and fixing its eye on you.Walking around and having it follow you is cool and all, but this thing shines when you\u2019re on the move and it\u2019s speeding to catch up with you. It\u2019s honestly so incredible to fire up the R1 and run through a dense forest with it trailing you; same goes for a bike ride. It speaks to Skydio\u2019s technology how few hiccups it had in the midst of extended sessions, though by extended session I mean around 15 minutes, as that was the average flight time I got from a single battery charge. The Frontier Edition R1 ships with a second battery, which was a godsend.When it comes to capturing precise, buttery smooth footage, there\u2019s no replacement for a skilled drone pilot. Even with a perfectly good gimbal, the movements of the R1 are often pretty sudden and lead to direction changes that look a bit weird on camera. Not every continuous shot you gather from the R1 will make the cut, but what\u2019s crazy is that you literally don\u2019t have to do anything. It just follows and records you, leaving you a lot of footage that you\u2019ll be able to pare down in editing.There are some things I don\u2019t love. It\u2019s too big for one; the company insists that it\u2019s still small enough to fit in a backpack, but unless it\u2019s a backpack that you could also load a 17-inch gaming laptop in, I kind of doubt that. The body feels light and substantial; but the rigidity of its outer frame and its overall size made me a little nervous at times that I was going to catastrophically break it, which was enough to make me consciously leave it at home when I was out on a snowboarding trip.I\u2019m also a little distraught by the company\u2019s decision to make this purely Wi-Fi controlled over your phone connection, a decision that definitely helps you from losing it, but also kind of limits its core utility when it comes to tracking people who are not holding the phone. I sicced the drone on a friend of mine who was running around a neighborhood area but after he took off in a sprint, the R1 lost the signal and it came to a stop over a street where I was left trying to reconnect and move it to safety as cars zoomed by a few feet beneath it.For $2,499, it\u2019s not ridiculous to desire some features that also make this more of a general-purpose drone, as well; all of the propellers are there, so it doesn\u2019t seem like it should be a coup to offer an add-on controller that extends the range from a few hundred feet as it currently is.Not a complaint at all, but I am excited to see the functionality gains this gets from future software updates; namely I think it\u2019d be really to fun to track a pet (it currently can only recognize humans). At one point when it was following me around in a park, it majorly freaked out a bunch of dogs, who promptly started chasing it \u2014 and by extension, me. The sadist in me kind of wanted to chase them back with the R1.The R1 is a $2,499 product with a feature that makes it particularly attractive to the first-time drone user who definitely won\u2019t spend that much money in the first place. In some ways this mismatch shows just how disruptive this tech could be, but in the short-term the targeted buyer of this drone is an extremely tight niche.For the early adopter who just loves getting the new thing, you\u2019ll be pleased that it actually works and isn\u2019t another half-baked dream on the road to autonomy. If you\u2019re a creator or vlogger who does a lot of solo trips in the great outdoors, this drone could definitely transform how you capture your trips and end up being a great buy \u2014 albeit a super pricey one.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/skydio-r1-review-a-mesmerizing-super-expensive-self-flying-drone/"},
{"title": ["Elon Musk just took charge of Model 3 production, saying it\u2019s his \u2018most critical\u2019 job right now"], "text": "You can probably argue over whether it\u2019s a good or a bad sign, but Tesla  CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter today a report in The Information that he has taken over direct control of the division that\u2019s producing Tesla\u2019s Model 3 electric sedan after the company failed to meet the delivery goals it set.Specifically, Tesla had intended to produce 500 Model 3 cars per day, or 2,500 per week, by the end of last month. But according to a company-wide email to employees that was sent today and obtained by Jalopnik, Musk said Tesla has been making closer to 2,000 of the cars per week. (Musk estimated last July that Tesla would be making 20,000 of the cars per month by December.)In his email \u2014 fired off at 3 a.m. PDT\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Musk added that if \u201cthings go as planned today, we will comfortably exceed that number over a seven day period!\u201dMusk may have been referring in part to the reorganization. But while The Information reported that Musk had seemingly \u201cpushed aside the company\u2019s senior vice president of engineering, Doug Field, who had been overseeing manufacturing in recent months,\u201d Musk quickly took issue with that characterization of events.He complained on Twitter to Information reporter Amir Efrati, \u201cCan\u2019t believe you\u2019re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what\u2019s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world\u2019s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering.\u201dMusk continued, tweeting: \u201cAbout a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed [engineering and production to be] better aligned, so we don\u2019t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I\u2019m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell \u2026\u201dThat Musk is feeling sensitive to press reports right now won\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who follows the company, given the string of negative publicity that Tesla has received in recent weeks.In addition to a voluntary recall of 123,000 Model S vehicles that owes to a problem with the power-steer component of some of the cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration last week launched an investigation into the role of Tesla\u2019s Autopilot in a fatal crash.In fact, in a series of separate tweets today, Musk responded to the National Transportation Safety Board, a safety agency that said it was \u201cunhappy\u201d with Tesla\u2019s decision on Friday to publish a blog post about the accident, given that investigations are ongoing.In that post, Tesla said the driver, since identified as an Apple engineer, \u201chad received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver\u2019s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision.\u201d The company also noted that a highway safety barrier that might have lessened the impact of the collision had been \u201ccrushed in a prior accident without being replaced.\u201dThe suggestion was plainly that Tesla can\u2019t be blamed, at least not entirely, for the fatality.In response to the NTSB\u2019s newly\u00a0public frustration over the release of these details by Tesla, Musk wrote on Twitter today, \u201cLot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe.\u201dTesla closed down 5.1 percent at $252.48 in trading today.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/elon-musk-just-took-charge-of-model-3-production-saying-its-his-most-critical-job-right-now/"},

CNBC\u2019s sources said the deal isn\u2019t final yet, but talks have been going on for months and Amazon was also a potential suitor for the startup, which delivers medications to tens of thousands of customers in the United States.Launched in 2013, PillPack has raised $118 million in funding from investors including Accel Partners, Atlas Venture and CRV. PillPack doesn\u2019t just fill prescriptions: it also helps patients manage their medications by sorting pills into packets for individual doses, automatically delivering refills to homes and providing 24/7 customer service, all major selling points for seniors and people with multiple conditions.

After Express Scripts cut off its partnership with PillPack, claiming that the company needed to be licensed as a mail-order operation instead of a retail pharmacy, PillPack said this would force it stop delivering to a third of its customers.

Online outcry by customers, driven by a PillPack campaign, forced Express Scripts to back down.Both Walmart and PillPack declined to comment on a potential acquisition to CNBC.Amazon  is said to be working on its own prescription delivery service, after launching a line of over-the-counter health products like allergy treatments.

{"title": ["Insider raises $11M to help internet marketers do better internet marketing"], "text": "Insider, a service that aims to help brands go about their internet marketing with greater efficiency and success, has landed an $11 million investment led by Sequoia India.The startup is originally from Turkey where it began life in 2012 as a platform that helped optimize online marketing campaigns. Now at 240 staff across 16 markets, it recently moved HQ to Singapore and today it launches its new \u2018Growth Management Platform.\u2019Those three words together don\u2019t really tell much about Insider\u2019s  new product, the aim of which is to help brands, marketers and website owners generally serve dynamic content that is tailored to their visitors. The idea according to Insider CEO\u00a0Hande Cilingir \u2014 who is one of six co-founders of the business \u2014 is to give a visitor the most optimized version of the site based on who they are. In many ways, it is similar to LiftIgniter, the U.S. startup that raised $6.4 million last year\u00a0and was a\u00a0finalist at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016.Insider goes about that task by collecting pieces of data about the visitor \u2014 the 90-odd parameters include obvious things include location, the website they are visiting from, the device they are on, etc \u2014 all of which is used to showcase the most relevant content or information to ensure that this visitor gets the best experience. Insider said it\u00a0uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to boost its model, too, helping match potential similarities between users to build a wider and more intelligent picture about the type of people visiting a website.The goal is really quite simple: keep people more engaged on a website and help website owners with their call to action, whatever that may be.\u00a0Insider believes it can help lower customer acquisition costs through increased efficiency, while also boost existing conversion rates through customization.In the case of internet marketing, it is most often to e-commerce or other types of purchases.That\u2019s strongly reflected in the customer base that Insider claims. The company has put a big focus on Asia\u2019s growing internet market \u2014 hence the move to Singapore \u2014\u00a0and publicly-announced clients for the startup include Singapore Airlines, Indonesian e-commerce firm Tokopedia, UNIQLO, Samsung, McDonald\u2019s, Nissan and CNN.Sequoia  could help open doors,\u00a0too, since the firm has invested in major consumer names in Asia such as Go-Jek, Carousell and Zomato.\u201cWe were impressed with Insider\u2019s AI platform, and the profound impact on their customer\u2019s key metrics: lower customer acquisition costs, higher retention, faster growth. These customers quickly started to use more and more products from the Insider platform. That has put Insider on a fast growth trajectory, especially in Asia,\u201d said Pieter Kemps, principal at Sequoia India.Cilingir said the new funds will go towards expanding Insider\u2019s sales team and hiring data scientists and machine learning engineers to develop the platform. The headquarters may be in Singapore now, but the product development and\u00a0the technical team is spread across Istanbul, Turkey, and Ukraine.The team is firmly focused on developing its business in Southeast Asia, she added, but it is also eying potential expansions with China and the U.S. among the more audacious new markets that it is considering at this point.Cilingir is bullish that there\u2019s more to come. Marketing giant Group M predicts that this is the year that online advertising spend overtakes TV for the\u00a0first time in 17 countries worldwide and she\u2019s optimistic that there will be a\u00a0greater need for Insider\u2019s products among brands and major consumer names worldwide.Alongside Sequoia, Insider said that its existing investors Wamda Capital and Dogan Group also took part in the newest round, which is its Series B.

The \u201co\u201d part of IPO stands for offering and Spotify isn\u2019t raising any money.Instead, existing Spotify shareholders will be selling shares directly onto the stock market. This means that employees, venture capitalists or anyone else who managed to buy Spotify shares on the\u00a0 \u201csecondary markets\u201d can make money right away. But Spotify doesn\u2019t know yet how many will want to sell their shares.In fact, no one really knows how this \u201cdirect listing\u201d is going to go. Even in Spotify\u2019s prospectus, the company acknowledged that what it\u2019s doing is \u201crisky.\u201d Smaller companies have listed without an IPO, but for a company of Spotify\u2019s size, this is unprecedented.Co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek claims that they are doing things differently because \u201cSpotify has never been a normal kind of company.\u201d In a release today, he wrote that \u201cour focus isn\u2019t on the initial splash. Instead, we will be working on trying to build, plan, and imagine for the long term.\u201dIn a recent investor presentation, Ek said Spotify is doing this because of \u201cour desire to become more transparent and more accessible.\u201d Unlike a traditional IPO where employees don\u2019t sell shares for months, known as a \u201clock-up,\u201d Spotify insiders can sell on day one.But like a typical IPO, Spotify will still be working with \u201cmarket makers\u201d to help determine the price that the company should begin trading. I\u2019m told that this could anytime during the trading day on Tuesday.Spotify doesn\u2019t know how many people will be selling shares. If few people opt to sell, it will drive the share price up, because of limited supply. If a lot of people sell, the reverse could happen, if investor demand doesn\u2019t match it. It\u2019s likely that this process will lead to increased volatility in the first few days or weeks of trading.But in the long-run, Spotify\u2019s performance in the stock market will largely depend on investor philosophies about the company and its business model.Some are concerned that Spotify will run the course of competitor Pandora, which has struggled on the stock market, partly due to hefty artist fees. Others argue that Spotify could be viewed as a Netflix, which has been successful at its entertainment licensing agreements.But regardless of what happens Tuesday, Ek said that listing day is not time to celebrate. \u201cYou won\u2019t see us ringing any bells or throwing any parties.\u201d\u00a0", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/what-to-expect-when-spotify-goes-public-tuesday/"},

The company had raised over $6 million from investors that include Qualcomm Ventures, Times Internet, Matrix Partners (which is also an Ola backer.)Ola isn\u2019t saying too much about how it plans to use Ridlr\u00a0other than that the deal will \u201cbring new technology and mobility options as [Ola] works to expand into and partner with cities in India and abroad.\u201d The company already offers a range of ride-sharing options, bike-sharing, food deliveries\u00a0and a mobile wallet, but it plans to give more color\u00a0on the proposed new services in the next month or so.In its deal scoop, Mint claimed Ridlr will help improve Ola\u2019s navigation and potentially see it add public transport booking options. That might sound at odds with a ride-hailing app, but when you consider\u00a0that many people use buses or trains for the bulk of their commute and a taxi to get to their final destination, the move could help Ola own the \u201cend-to-end\u201d journey in full. At the least, that\u2019s a strategy that Uber hasn\u2019t explored and that potential alone \u2014 to be a differentiator \u2014 might make it worth a look.Ridlr will continue to operate as an independent business \u201cfor now,\u201d an Ola representative told TechCrunch, who also clarified that it will become a\u00a0wholly owned subsidiary of Ola parent Ani Technologies.Albeit seemingly not an expensive one, this deal marks Ola\u2019s seventh investment.The largest outlays have been rival TaxiForSure for $200 million in 2015 and FoodPanda India last December which relaunched its food delivery business. Other deals have included taxi radio service\u00a0Gcabs.in, trip-planning service Geotagg and payment startup Qarth. The firm also made a minority investment in Zipcash.Despite today\u2019s news, the larger story around Ola is whether it will merge with Uber in the same way that the U.S. firm recently struck a deal with Grab to exit money-losing market Southeast Asia.Uber CEO Dara\u00a0Khosrowshahi has said that there will be no more global retreats \u2014 Uber previously struck exit deals in China and Russia \u2014 but there has been constant press speculation and reports of an ongoing dialogue between Uber and Ola over a potential deal. Unlike China and Southeast Asia, sources at Uber believe that the company\u2019s India-based service is ahead of the local rival so don\u2019t feel the need to push for consolidation.But there are other factors.As was the case with Grab and Didi, Ola counts SoftBank  as an investor and, since it landed an investment in Uber, the Japanese firm has been pushing for Uber to do deals in unprofitable markets and focus on more lucrative countries in the West. The issue is particularly acute since Uber is reportedly targeting an IPO as soon as 2019 and it would need to get its finances in line accordingly.Nonetheless, Ola is already branching out overseas via a recent launch in Australia and, publicly at least, it is committed to being around for \u201cdecades.\u201d\u201cIn India\u2019s transformative digital journey, Ola will always be an active and integral part for decades to come. SoftBank and all other investors are committed in realizing this ambition. Ola is always actively looking for opportunities for expansion of its footprint,\u201d the firm told TechCrunch in a statement.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/ola-acquires-ridlr/"},
{"title": ["Making policing more responsive, SPIDR Tech raises $2.5 million"], "text": "Across the country, police brutality and the series of fatal shootings of mostly black men have soured many on the role that police officers play in the community. To combat those negative assessments, police forces are turning to an array of new technologies, such as body cameras, new communications technologies and social media monitoring services to (ostensibly) become more accountable to and engaged with the citizens they\u2019re policing.With the new wave of spending comes more venture capital dollars invested in technologies that entrepreneurs are developing to solve these problems.Los Angeles-based SPIDR Tech, founded by two former officers, Rahul Sidhu and Elon Kaiserman, is one of the companies benefiting from this newfound interest in policing technology. The company raised $2.5 million from investors, including Sidewalk Labs (the urban tech subsidiary of Alphabet, Google\u2019s holding company), Birchmere Ventures, Stage Ventures, Kairos Association, Heartland Ventures and No Name Ventures.From Tucson to San Antonio and Grover Beach to Redondo Beach, police departments are using SPIDR Tech\u2019s  automated messaging system to help departments respond to victims of crimes and keep them informed of the status of the investigation into their case.A graduate of the Techstars New York accelerator a few years ago, when I first saw the company they were focused on providing actionable intelligence and monitoring services to police departments, but pivoted into a communications platform when the company saw a bigger opportunity to help departments there.\u201cOriginally we were focused on police departments having the data they need to make actionable decisions,\u201d Sidhu says. \u201c[But] we had to look at what could we do with their data to make immediate changes.\u201dRather than focus on predictive policing using fairly spotty data sets, SPIDR turned to improving communications. A small thing that Sidhu says can make a large difference in how policing is perceived.The idea goes back to advice that Sidhu was given by his commanding officer when he was a rookie in his department. \u201cEvery department has a bank of trust,\u201d Sidhu says. \u201cEvery time you walk an old lady across the street or you touch someone on the shoulder\u2026 you\u2019re making a deposit in the bank of trust.\u201d\u00a0Establishing better, more responsive lines of communication becomes an easy way for departments to get another credit in that trust bank, he says. And, according to Sidhu, it works. In Tucson, the company has been running polls on the approval rating of the police department, and the scores increase among citizens who have received messages from the SPIDR service.\u201cI was sitting on a boat with the chief of the Burlington Vermont department. He was telling me you need to focus on public perception\u2026 focus on something that might seem small but can make the departments feel like they\u2019re getting results,\u201d says Sidhu.\u00a0Sidhu compares the technology to the kind of customer service that people get from private industry. \u201cCustomers of Amazon have confidence that Amazon is going to fulfill the order\u2026 that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing for customers of law enforcement,\u201d he says. \u201cWho are law enforcement\u2019s customers? They\u2019re victims of a crime\u2026 we call them reporting parties. And we handle the relationship between the reporting parties and departments.\u201dThe service isn\u2019t for the sensitive cases that departments handle \u2014 which Sidhu says isn\u2019t where departments are struggling, anyway. \u201cThey\u2019re struggling with the 90 percent to 95 percent of investigations. That\u2019s where we come in so that they can set a baseline and set that bar.\u201dIn Tucson, where the victim notification program is already up and running, SPIDR has sent more than 1,000 texts and emails to victims of petty crimes to keep them informed on the status of a department\u2019s investigations into their case.\u201cThese automated messages provide specific information to the victims to include contact information for various police substations, detective details and relevant case information. The limited staffing at the police department simply does not allow this level of engagement for every reported incident possible,\u201d wrote Tucson Assistant Chief Eric Kazmierczak. \u201cWithout automation, this simply would not be possible. SPIDR Engage provides a completely automated method for the department to disseminate information to crime victims at the time the crime is reported. The Department is also working toward having SPIDR Engage provide real-time updates in changes of status for each case (e.g. your case has been assigned to Detective X, an arrest has been made in your case, your case has been closed, etc.) SPIDR is providing a service to the police department that allows the police department to maintain better communication with its community when it matters most.\u201dSPIDR is one of a growing number of startups providing better data analytics tools to police departments nationwide. Last month, Mark43 raised $38 million from investors led by General Catalyst and Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital. Additional investors included Spark Capital, Ashton Kutcher\u2019s Sound Ventures, Bezos Expeditions,\u00a0Goldman Sachs and General David Petraeus.Mark43 may be the best capitalized of the new companies working on data and communications tools for police, but it\u2019s far from the only one. Recent Y Combinator graduate Elucd is also working on data and information technology tools for police departments, but it\u2019s focused on the sentiment analysis of the neighborhoods that departments serve.Sidhu explains the services this way: Mark43 provides better records management tools for departments, his company takes that information and uses it to communicate more effectively with the community and Elucd takes the pulse of the community\u2019s assessment of how its officers are doing.\u201cOur goal is for this year 2018 to ensure that our customers can rival private sector companies in ensuring that people are staying in the loop and they know what\u2019s happening with the investigation,\u201d Sidhu says.

The company is now testing a new \u201cSkype for Content Creators\u201d  mode for its desktop app that will allow creators to place and record calls using Skype software, which can either be streamed live or imported into other apps for further editing before posting.The feature is currently in \u201cpreview\u201d \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s term for software that\u2019s being tested with select users ahead of a broader, public release.Explains the company in a blog post, Skype for Content Creators will allow\u00a0digital broadcasters, streamers, and vloggers to record videos, podcasts and live streaming calls \u201cwithout having to invest in expensive studio equipment.\u201d Instead, Windows 10 and Mac users will be able to use the Content Creators mode to place and record their calls directly in NDI-enabled software like\u00a0Wirecast,\u00a0Xsplit, or\u00a0Vmix, for example. Users won\u2019t need other recording or screen capture software, the company notes. The look-and-feel of the call can be customized, too.The feature will work best for those who record video chats with other remote guests \u2013 like for a weekly call-in show \u2013 but it can also work for calls that are live streamed to other platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube.If the call is not being live-streamed, the recording can be imported into other apps for further editing, like\u00a0Adobe Premier Pro or Adobe Audition.This isn\u2019t the first time Skype has sought to leverage a specific use case to encourage people to adopt its communication software. For instance, the company\u00a0launched Skype Interviews\u00a0last year, aimed at recruiters who want to test candidates\u2019 coding skills during their chats. In both cases, Skype is targeting a subset of its users with features built just for them. Retaining users and appealing to newcomers is critical as Skype\u2019s growth has plateaued in recent years. At Microsoft Build 2016, the company said it has 300 million users\u00a0\u2013 the same figure it cited on Skype\u2019s 10th birthday several years prior.Microsoft isn\u2019t the only company trying to simply streaming video for content creators, as of late, however.

Facebook  shut down accounts related to Russian GRU military intelligence-linked group APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, which had created an organization called DCLeaks run by fake personas to seed stolen information to journalists.Wired detailed the methods of the \u201cAdvanced Persistent Threat 28\u201d group in January 2017. APT28 uses zero-day exploits, malware-equipped spearfishing emails, publicly known but unfixed vulnerabilities in computer systems and malicious iFrames embedded in hacked websites to steal people\u2019s files. The group has been connected to attacks against\u00a0NATO, French television station TV5Monde and the World Anti-Doping Agency.The Washington Post reported in September 2017 that Facebook had detected the APT28 accounts in June 2016 and reported their activity to the FBI, but didn\u2019t detail that Facebook had fought back directly by shutting down their accounts. Facebook had not previously confirmed this story.Here\u2019s Zuckerberg\u2019s full explanation of the situation:The Post reported that APT28 was known for stealing data and military plans from political targets, leading Facebook\u2019s security team to assume it was planning traditional espionage rather than a more public-facing disinformation campaign to skew the election. But they did share their findings with the FBI. Later, when Facebook discovered APT28 had created the Guccifer 2.0 hacker persona and DCLeaks Facebook to deliver stolen emails and documents to journalists, Facebook contacted the FBI again. Guccifer 2.0, who had claimed sole responsibility for providing hacked Democratic National Convention emails to WikiLeaks, has since been identified as a GRU operative.Now Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony indicates Facebook didn\u2019t just hand off responsibility to the FBI, but worked to combat the trolls on its own.This information could give Facebook and Zuckerberg a better defense as he\u2019s questioned by the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees Tuesday, then the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday. If Facebook can demonstrate that it wasn\u2019t completely asleep at the wheel regarding election interference, it could get softer treatment than if Congress thinks it was caught completely off-guard.You can see Zuckerberg\u2019s full prepared testimony below:Zuckerberg Statement to Congress by Jordan Crook on Scribd", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/facebook-apt28/"},

For example, a Delaware bank issues the debit cards and a Georgia bank helps with photo deposits of checks.There are some small fees involved with using PayPal\u2019s banking services, including ATM fees for withdrawals from those not in PayPal\u2019s MoneyPass network, and 1 percent of any check deposited via a photo from a\u00a0smartphone. However, it won\u2019t charge monthly fees or require minimum balances.Traditional banking customers may not want to pay for things like check deposits, but the lower fees will appeal to those who usually go to payday lenders, and don\u2019t have regular bank accounts, the company tells us.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to bring more of those people into the digital economy,\u201d Bill Ready, EVP and Chief Operating Officer at PayPal, tells TechCrunch. \u201cFor folks who don\u2019t have bank accounts, for folks who don\u2019t have credit and debit cards, we want to give them something so they\u2019re not turning to prepaid cards, check cashiers and payday lenders.\u201dHe says there are billions of people in the world without bank accounts, including some 30 million in the U.S. These people spend nine-and-half percent of their income on interest and fees from alternative financial services, he notes.PayPal today already offers consumers a debit card\u00a0(PayPal\u2019s Cash card) for loading accounts with cash at retailers, as one way of serving the underbanked or unbanked user base. There\u2019s also\u00a0the PayPal prepaid MasterCard\u00a0linked to PayPal customer accounts and\u00a0other credit products.The new banking products won\u2019t be tied to a yet another debit card, but will be offered to existing prepaid card holders \u2013 something that wasn\u2019t detailed in the original report.The banking services have quietly been in testing with select consumers over the past several months, Ready says, and will begin rolling out publicly in the \u201cweeks and months\u201d ahead. They will certainly be live in the first half of 2018, he confirms.PayPal will determine the best candidates for the new banking products, based on how customers are already using its services.\u201cFor the consumers already in our base that we see using things like loading cash directly onto a PayPal account in retail locations\u2026we\u2019ll reach out directly,\u201d he says.\u00a0In some \u201cbanking deserts,\u201d it may also invest in out-of-home advertising to reach those people without as many options.The company is not alone in targeting those underserved by mainstream banks.Amazon was recently cited as having\u00a0discussions with banks regarding its own possible launch of consumer-facing banking services. Meanwhile, Square\u2019s Cash app has been doling out bank cards to its users, as has its rival, the PayPal-owned\u00a0Venmo. There are also digital banking services like\u00a0Simple, Chime, and Varo Money, for example, which take advantage of new technology to address consumer needs, while having accounts backed by traditional banking partners. (Or in the case of Simple, owners \u2013 given BBVA\u2019s acquisition of the service years ago.)However, many of these existing digital banking efforts are targeting younger consumers, including millennials, who prefer to use apps to manage their money, save, and even invest. And if they get a card at all, they opt for debit over credit, studies have found.But PayPal says it\u2019s not going after millennials with its new products, just the \u201cunbanked\u201d population in general.\u201cThe [banked and unbanked] divide isn\u2019t necessarily along generational lines\u2026those that are unbanked don\u2019t have access to traditional financial services.

{"title": ["Here are the five things I learned installing a smart mirror"], "text": "I recently received a review unit of the Embrace Smart Mirror. It\u2019s essentially a 24-inch Android  tablet mounted behind a roughly 40-inch mirror. It works well when third-party software is installed. Here\u2019s what I learned.It\u2019s impossible to get a good photo of the smart mirrorI tried a tripod, a selfie stick and every possible angle and I couldn\u2019t get a picture that does this mirror justice. It looks better in person than these photos show. When the light in the bathroom is on, the text on the mirror appears to float on the surface. It looks great. The time is nice and large, and the data below it is accessible when standing a few feet away.When the room is dark, the Android device\u2019s screen\u2019s revealed because it can\u2019t reach real black. The screen behind the mirror glows gray. This isn\u2019t a big deal. The Android device turns off after a period of inactivity and is often triggered when the light to the bathroom is turned on. More times than not, people walking into the room will be greeted with a standard mirror until the light is turned on.There are a handful of smart mirror apps, but few are worthwhileThis smart mirror didn\u2019t ship with any software outside of Android. That\u2019s a bummer, but not a deal-breaker. There are several smart mirror Android apps in the Play Store, though I only found one I like.I settled on Mirror Mirror (get it) because the interface is clean, uses pleasant fonts and there\u2019s just enough customization, though it would be nice to select different locations for the data modules. The app was last updated in July of 2017, so use at your own risk.Another similar option is this software developed by Max Braun, a robotistic at Google\u2019s X. His smart mirror was a hit in 2016, and he included instructions on how to build it here and uploaded the software to GitHub here.Kids love itI have great kids that grew up around technology. Nothing impresses these jerks, though, and that\u2019s my fault. But they like this smart mirror.\u00a0They won\u2019t stop touching it, leaving fingerprints all over it. They quickly figured out how to exit the mirror software and download a bunch of games to the device. I\u2019ve walked in on both kids huddled in the dark bathroom playing games and watching YouTube, instead, of you know, playing games or watching YouTube on the countless other devices in the house.That\u2019s the point of the device, though. The company that makes this model advertises it as a way to get YouTube in the bathrooms so a person can apply their makeup while watching beauty YouTubers. It works for that, too. There is just a tiny bit of latency when pressing on the screen through the mirror. This device isn\u2019t as quick to use as a new Android tablet, but because it\u2019s sealed in a way to keep out moisture, it\u2019s safe to go in a steamy bathroom.Adults will find it frivolousI have a lot of gadgets in my house, and my friends are used to it. Their reaction to this smart mirror has been much different from any other device, though.\u201cWhat the hell is this, Matt,\u201d they\u2019ll say from behind the closed bathroom door. I\u2019ll yell back, \u201cIt\u2019s a smart mirror.\u201d They flush the toilet, walk out and give me the biggest eye roll.I\u2019ve yet to have an adult say anything nice about this mirror.It is frivolousA smart mirror is a silly gadget. To some degree, it\u2019s a crowd-pleaser, but in the end, it\u2019s just another gadget to tell you the weather. It collects fingerprints like mad, and the Android screen isn\u2019t bright enough to use it as a regular video viewer or incognito TV.As for this particular smart mirror, the Embrace Smart Mirror, the hardware is solid but doesn\u2019t include any smart mirror software. The Mirror is rather thin and easily hangs on a wall thanks to a VESA port. There are physical controls hidden along the bottom of the unit, including a switch to manually turn off the camera. It\u2019s certified IP65, so it can handle a bathroom. A motion detector does a good job turning the device on. If you don\u2019t have kids, it should stay smudge-free.The Embrace Smart Mirror does not ship with any smart mirror software. The instructions and videos tell users to add widgets to the Android home screen. This doesn\u2019t work for me, and I expect a product such as this to include at least necessary software. Right now, after this product is taken out of the box, it\u2019s just an Android tablet behind a mirror, and that\u2019s lame. Thankfully there are a couple of free apps on the Play Store to remedy this problem.At $1,299, the Embrace Smart Mirror is a hard sell, but is among the cheapest available smart mirrors on the market. Of course, you can always build one yourself \u2014\u00a0as The Verge points out, it\u2019s rather easy.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/here-are-the-five-things-i-learned-installing-a-smart-mirror-in-my-house/"},

The company is introducing a range of new exercise types, as well as a new leveling system that lets you choose between delving deeper into specific skills or learning new content.When you are building a popular language learning service like Duolingo,  you\u2019re inevitably confronted with a problem: Some of your users are really serious about learning a new language and some are just casual users. Finding a balance is hard, even as you try to personalize the experience for every user. But as you add harder content, user engagement goes down and learners drop off.To counter this, Duolingo is now launching \u201cCrown Levels.\u201d These new levels are part of a redesigned skills tree that gives users a choice between delving into harder content about a specific skill \u2014 or moving on to new skills.The company quietly announced this feature earlier this year and after A/B testing it, decided to launch it to a wider audience now. \u201cWhenever we tried to add harder content in order to teach better, our engagement metrics would go down. Learners would get discouraged and leave the app,\u201d the team explained at the time. \u201cThis made it really hard to make any progress on our goal to not just be a\u00a0fun\u00a0learning app, but an\u00a0effective\u00a0one that really taught you a language well.\u201dThe new tree now allows casual learners to move through the Duolingo skills tree just like before, while advanced learners can dig deeper into the new skills they just learned. Ideally, this means that everybody should be happy now and learn better.With this update, Duolingo is also introducing a number of new exercise types that focus on listening and pronunciation. Among those is a new set of phonetics exercises around pronouncing specific sounds, as well as a new exercise type that asks you to tap words as you listen to them.

As of today, the company\u2019s officially adding retail stores, offices and co-located facilities to that list, covering 43 countries, including the US, China, UK and India. The addition of nine manufacturing partners, meanwhile, brings the total number up to 23 suppliers promising to produce their products entirely with clean energy. How the companies involved actually hit these numbers is, unsurprisingly, somewhat more complex. \u201cWhere feasible, we produce our own renewable energy by building our own renewable energy facilities, including solar arrays, wind farms, biogas fuel cells, and micro-hydro generation systems,\u201d the company writes in its 2017 Environmental Responsibility Report. \u201cWhere it\u2019s not feasible to build our own generation, we sign long-term renewable energy purchase contracts, supporting new, local projects that meet our robust renewable energy sourcing principles.\u201dThe push toward renewable energy has included some creative solutions, including 300 solar rooftops in Japan and 800 in Singapore.\u00a0The company says it\u2019s currently running 25 renewable energy projects globally, with 15 more in the process of being built. That will bump green energy capability from 626 megawatts to 1.4 gigawatts, by its count \u2014 and the finally tally doesn\u2019t appear to include carbon offsets, unlike some of the competition.\u00a0It\u2019s easy to see how a rollback of the Clean Power Plan could ultimately have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s bottom line. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to leaving the world better than we found it.

The two-year program trains full-stack engineers with a focus on the basics of engineering and sees itself as an alternative to a traditional college experience. Today, the San Francisco-based school announced that it has raised an $8.2 million Series A round that will help it expand its programs.The funding round was led by current investors daphni and Trinity Ventures. The Omidyar Network joined as a new investor. With this, the school has now raised a total of $13 million.Holberton is currently teaching about 200 students (who have to pass a pretty rigorous entry exam) and the plan is to scale the program to 1,000 students per year. That\u2019s a larger cohort than the computer science programs taught at even the biggest schools currently. Past students have found jobs at companies like Apple, IBM, Tesla, Docker and Dropbox. Instead of charging tuition, the school takes a 17 percent cut of its graduates\u2019 salary for the first three years after they get their jobs.To enable its expansion to 1,000 students, the team recently moved into a far larger space in San Francisco that can handle about 500 students. As the team has repeatedly told me, part of its mission is to bring in a diverse group of students \u2014 and one that isn\u2019t held back by the prospect of student loans. In its recent classes, about 40 percent of the students were women, for example, and a slight majority of students were minorities.

{"title": ["Congress should demand Zuckerberg move to \u2018one share, one vote\u2019"], "text": "Mark Zuckerberg  is an autocrat, and not hypothetically. Through his special voting rights held in Facebook\u2019s Class B shares, he wields absolute command of the company, while owning just a handful of percentage points of the company\u2019s equity.Like any autocrat, he has taken extraordinary measures to maintain control over his realm. He produced a plan exactly two years ago that would have zeroed out the voting rights for everyday shareholders with a new voteless Class C share, only to pull back at the last minute as a Delaware court case was set to begin. He has received the irrevocable proxies of many Facebook insiders, allowing him to control their votes indefinitely. Plus, any Class B shares that are sold are converted to Class A shares, allowing him to continue to consolidate power as people leave.And now, borrowing a page straight out of George Orwell\u2019s 1984, he has even tried to retract and disappear his own messages to others on his platform (which has now been retracted itself after it became public).While Congress is right to focus on Cambridge Analytica, and electoral malfeasance, and political ads, and a whole crop of other controversies surrounding Facebook,  it should instead direct its attention to the single solution that would begin to solve all of this: dissolve Facebook\u2019s dual-class share structure and thereby democratize its ownership.Just as congressmen are elected under the principle of \u201cone man, one vote,\u201d it should demand that Facebook follow the highest standards used by most other publicly listed companies and return to \u201cone share, one vote.\u201dZuckerberg himself should certainly agree with this. After all, the original logic of creating a voteless share class was that the company\u2019s financial performance was strong and Zuckerberg needed to be protected to continue it that way. The plan was announced the same quarter that Facebook crushed its financial results, and there was an absolutely implied connection between those results and the controlling stake held by Zuckerberg.Yet in the two months, from its intraday peak at a share price of $195.32 on February 1, 2018 to today\u2019s price of $160, Facebook has lost more than $100 billion in its market cap. If Congressional inquiries eventually lead to further regulation, it could further erode the value of the stock. It\u2019s easy to argue that a chief executive should be protected when the performance of a company is rocketing up. It\u2019s much harder when everything is crumbling and no one is being held accountable.Shareholders may have been blinded by Facebook\u2019s dizzying growth over the past few years, but we now know that the edifice of that growth is far more tenuous than we ever knew before. Zuckerberg\u2019s 15-year apology tour can no longer sustain the view that corporate governance should be ignored for the good of the share price.There\u2019s just one problem though, and it is the problem that confronts any country with a tyrant: shareholders have no power here to affect change. They can\u2019t change the composition of the board, they can\u2019t change the management team. They can\u2019t change anything at all, because one person controls the realm with an iron fist. A proposal back in 2015 to move to \u201cone share, one vote\u201d was struck down at Facebook\u2019s shareholder meeting.I am not asking for Zuckerberg to be fired, or to resign. I think people should clean up their own messes, and few people have the means to clean up Facebook right now other than him. But I do think there should be consequences, and so far, there have been exactly zero. Zuckerberg has to personally relinquish his control, and no act of mea culpa would better show that he understands the consequences of his actions.There is a counter-argument, which is that ravenous mobs of private investors would swoop into Facebook and force the company to steal even more data from users to sell to advertisers if Zuckerberg lost control. I am wholly unconvinced though, mostly because Facebook has basically done precisely that over its entire history. Plus, any further deterioration of trust with users would strike at the heart of its financial results.Zuckerberg says in his prepared statement that, \u201cMy top priority has always been our social mission of connecting people, building community and bringing the world closer together.\u201d There are few things he could do to build the community around Facebook\u2019s leadership than sharing the burdens and the responsibilities with a wider, more diverse set of people.

{"title": ["What Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional testimony doesn\u2019t say"], "text": "There\u2019s a lot of keen analytical hindsight on display in Facebook  chief executive Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s written testimony to Congress ahead of his appearance at hearings on Wednesday, but nothing that indicates Facebook is ready to come to terms with the problems rotting the core of the social network.The bulk of Zuckerberg\u2019s opening statement is an historical analysis of the events of the past two years that have bruised the company\u2019s reputation and share price.Zuckerberg is defending his company on two fronts as he faces down the members of Congress that could regulate his company out of existence \u2014 user privacy and platform integrity.In the testimony, Zuckerberg highlights the initial steps that Facebook has taken to close down access for third parties and to do more to combat fake accounts and the spread of misinformation.These steps constitute what are now Zuckerberg\u2019s usual assurances\u2026 Facebook is sacrificing its own profits to develop new tools and hire new personnel to combat bad actors that would leverage Facebook\u2019s user information for their own fun and profit. Facebook has taken steps before the U.S. election to root out bad actors and will take even more steps now \u2014 since those initial efforts weren\u2019t enough.Near the close of his written testimony, Zuckerberg writes: \u201cI want to be clear about what our priority is: protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.\u201dWhat Zuckerberg\u2019s testimony fails to mention, as ever, is whether users themselves will ever be protected from Facebook.Ultimately Facebook\u2019s scandal is about how much the company knows about its users and how much power those users then have to control how Facebook applies (or shares) its knowledge.As Wired columnist Zeynep Tufekci pointed out in a column this weekend, that\u2019s been Facebook\u2019s problem\u00a0since the company\u2019s inception.All of the steps that Facebook is taking now to \u201cmake sure what happened with Kogan and Cambridge Analytica  doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d only achieve one thing \u2014 consolidating Facebook\u2019s control over the user data that it can make available to its customers.The policies just reduce the funnel of information that application developers, advertisers and others can freely access (the emphasis here is on free). For those who want to pay the company for the information \u2014 there\u2019s no guarantee that it won\u2019t be used in some way.As Tufekci writes, Facebook is a surveillance engine \u2014 that\u2019s the core of its business and the sale of that surveillance to bidders is the way that it functions to connect its \u201ccommunity.\u201d And protecting that community is a good way to also protect Facebook\u2019s profits.The problem for Facebook begins with the platform itself \u2014 and Zuckerberg\u2019s designs for it. And it won\u2019t be solved with a single congressional hearing.To pre-empt Congressional questioning and change the conversation, Zuckerberg could have offered solutions for Facebook to proactively address the problems that bedevil it \u2014 beyond the adoption of the One scenario that could free Facebook from the advertising chains that ostensibly bind it to being a digital surveillance state is the introduction of a subscription service\u00a0(as my colleague Josh Constine suggested earlier this year).For regulators looking at potential legal solutions, the application of GDPR standards across the entire Facebook platform would be a step in the right direction. Zuckerberg has committed to it, but his company has a history of failing to live up to its promises to users. Perhaps Congress will find a way to convince Facebook\u2019s chief to help the company keep its word\u2026 and avoid another apology tour.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/what-zuckerbergs-congressional-testimony-doesnt-say/"},

Originally a video messaging app, Tribe  failed to gain traction in the face of Snapchat and Facebook Messenger. But thanks to a $3 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins in June, Tribe had the runway to pivot into video chat gaming that could prove popular, even if not in its app.\u201cAs we all know, Messaging is a super-crowded area,\u201d says Tribe co-founder Cyril Paglino. \u201cIf you look closely, very few communication products have been blowing up in the past three years.\u201d Now, he says \u201cwe\u2019re building a \u2018Social Game Boy.'\u201dA former breakdancer, Paglino formed his team in France before renting a \u201chacker house\u201d and moving to San Francisco.

Tribe\u2019s most innovative feature was speech recognition that could turn a mention of \u201ccoffee\u201d into a pre-made calendar request, a celebrity\u2019s name into a link to their social media accounts, locations into maps and even offer Spotify links to songs playing in the background.The promise of being the next hit teen app secured Tribe a $500,000 pre-seed from Kima and Ludlow Ventures in 2015, a $2.5 million seed in 2016 led by prestigious fund Sequoia Capital  and then the June 2017 $3 million bridge from KPCB and others. But that $6 million couldn\u2019t change the fact that people didn\u2019t want to sign up for a new chat app when their friends were already established on others.Luckily, Tribe saw a new trend emerging. Between HQ Trivia\u2019s rise, the Apple App Store adding a Gaming tab, celebrities like Drake streaming their gameplay and Snapchat acquiring 3D gaming engine PlayCanvas, the Tribe team believed there was demand for a new way to play.Tribe\u2019s rebuilt iOS and Android apps let you rally a crew of friends or join in with strangers to play one of its old-school games.

TechCrunch broke the news of Nametags code in Instagram\u2019s Android APK last month. But now thanks to reader Genady Okrain we have screenshots and more details of the Instagram Nametags feature.Nametags could make it easier for people to visually promote their Instagram account. It could make it simple to follow a friend you just met by having them open their Nametag and then you scanning it. Meanwhile, businesses and social media stars could post their Nametag across other social media handles, print it onto posters or handbills or even make merchandise out of it.An Instagram spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that it is testing the Nametags feature.\u00a0Instagram\u2019s been spotted doing a flurry of feature development lately. TechCrunch has reported that code for an\u00a0Instagram Video Calling feature was found in its Android APK. Meanwhile, it\u2019s testing a\u00a0Portrait mode feature called Focus.Once users have access, they\u2019ll be able to hit a QR scanner button on their profile to bring up the Nametag editor.

But the code we discovered explains that users can scan them to follow people.Snapchat in January 2015 launched its own Snapcodes that work similarly, meaning Instagram took its time copying this feature. But with social media stars and businesses banished to Snapchat\u2019s Discover channel, those accounts might be looking to prioritize promoting their Instagram accounts. If creators find it easier to build an audience on Instagram and get more engagement there, they could give the Facebook-owned app their first-run content.

{"title": ["Stringify relaunches to automate the Comcast smart home"], "text": "Stringify, an IFTTT-like app that lets consumers control and automate their smart home devices, was quietly snatched up by Comcast last fall\u00a0to join the company\u2019s larger efforts\u00a0involving the smart home and the Internet of Things. Today, in its first major update post-acquisition, Stringify is relaunching its app with a new look-and-feel, deeper integrations with Comcast\u2019s services, as well as support for new hardware devices.Comcast had wanted its own entry point into smart home management that would not only allow the company to compete with popular voice platforms like Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple\u2019s HomePod, but also help better position its own services \u2013 like TV and internet \u2013 as essential pieces to the smart home experience.Stringify is helping with that. You can think of the app as something like IFTTT \u2013 the automation service that lets you create automatic routines that are triggered by various events. But in Stringify\u2019s case, there\u2019s a bigger focus on automating the smart home.With today\u2019s relaunch of Stringify, the app is now integrated with Comcast\u2019s TV platform, X1, as well as its newer personalized home Wi-Fi offering, xFi.That means Comcast users can connect their smart home devices \u2013 and their notifications \u2013 to their TVs, and create their own automated routines that run when certain events trigger them.For example, you could schedule family movie nights and have the TV channel changed automatically while dimming the lights, Comcast suggests. You could automate pausing the home\u2019s Wi-Fi at dinnertime, or get an alert on your TV when a connected camera detects motion outside. And even without smart home devices, you can do things like get a reminder to close the garage door when it gets windy, or display your commute time at 7 AM, the company also says.In addition to the Comcast integrations, Stringify also now works with\u00a0Lutron Caseta dimmers and switches, Serena shades, and\u00a0Carrier\u2019s line of Cor WiFi thermostats. At the time of the acquisition, Stringify was already working with over 500 products, so this just adds a few more.Comcast had announced at CES 2018 that it would soon bring the Stringify technology to its own services, like X1 TV and xFi Wi-Fi. Also launching today is Stringify\u2019s first Android Wear watch app that lets you activate your scenes \u2013 like \u201ccoming home\u201d or \u201cgoing to bed\u201d with a tap on your watch screen.Stringify\u2019s releaunch comes at a time when smart home automation is becoming more advanced. Both Google Home and Amazon Alexa now support \u201croutines\u201d that will kick off a series of actions when you speak a voice command.\u00a0However, Stringify is not yet integrated with the X1 voice remote for kicking off its own routines (called \u201cflows\u201d) through voice commands. That means it\u2019s not a replacement for voice platforms like Alexa or Google Assistant in terms of managing the smart home.\u201cWhat we love about the Stringify app is that it has a tremendous community of smart, devoted users who are on the leading edge of automation technology,\u201d said Sri Solur, Senior Vice President, Xfinity Home and IoT Products, Comcast Cable. \u201cSo, the development we do here plays a big role in our broader effort to create powerful new home automation experiences for our Xfinity customers.\u201dStringify, which is now sporting a more Xfinity-like interface, is available for download\u00a0on iOS and Android.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/stringify-relaunches-to-automate-the-comcast-smart-home/"},
{"title": ["IBM updates its skinny mainframe lineup"], "text": "When you think of mainframes, chances are you are thinking about some massive piece of hardware that costs millions and can be used as furniture. Now, IBM wants to change that perception with the launch of its latest additions to its Z-series machines, the IBM  z14 Model ZR1,\u00a0that\u2019s basically a standard 19-inch server rack. With its single-frame design, this new mainframe easily fits into any standard cloud data center or private cloud environment. In addition to the new z14, IBM is also launching an update to the similarly sized Rockhopper server.In many ways, the new z14 ZR1 is the successor of the company\u2019s entry-level z13s mainframe\u00a0(though, I guess we can argue over the fact whether any mainframe is really \u2018entry-level\u2019 to begin with). IBM says the new z14 offers 10 percent more capacity and twice the memory (a whopping 8 terabyte) of its predecessor and that it can handle more than 850 million fully encrypted transactions per day on a single system (though IBM didn\u2019t go into details as to what kind of transactions we\u2019re talking about here.\u201cThis will bring the power of the\u00a0IBM\u00a0Z to an even broader center of clients seeking robust security with pervasive encryption, machine learning, cloud capabilities and powerful analytics,\u201dsaid Ross Mauri, general manager of\u00a0IBM\u00a0Z, in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cNot only does this increase security and capability in on-premises and hybrid cloud environments for clients, we also will deploy the new systems in our\u00a0IBM public cloud data centers as we focus on enhancing security and performance for increasingly intensive data loads.\u201dMainframes, it\u2019s worth noting, may not be the sexiest computing segment out there, but they remain a solid business for IBM and even in the age of microservices, plenty of companies, especially in the financial services industry, are still betting on these high-powered machines. According to IBM, 44 of the top 50 banks and 90 percent of the largest airlines use its Z-series mainframes today. Unlike its gigantuous predecessors, today\u2019s mainframes don\u2019t need special cooling or energy supplies and these days, they happily run Linux and all of your standard software, too.In addition to the ZR1, IBM also today launched the\u00a0LinuxONE Rockhopper II, a more traditional Linux server that also fits into a single-frame 19-inch rack. The new Rockhopper now also support up to 8 terabytes of memory and can handle up to 330,000 Docker containers. While the ZR1 is for companies that want to update their current mainframes, the Rockhopper\u00a0II is clearly geared toward companies that have started to rethink their software architecture with modern DevOps practices in mind.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/ibm-updates-its-skinny-mainframe-lineup/"},

Index Ventures is leading the round, Xavier Niel is participating as well as existing investors CNP Assurances, Partech and Portag3 Ventures LP.Alan  wants to make health insurance as simple as subscribing to a software-as-a-service product. It starts with clear pricing and transparent reimbursement policies. For instance, you can cover a 30-year-old employee for \u20ac55 per month.The price will be exactly the same for all types of companies. The only thing that changes is that you\u2019ll pay a bit less for younger employees and more for older employees. Each employee can choose to cover their significant other for the same price, and their kids for an extra \u20ac40 per month.And then, Alan is following the startup playbook. The overall user experience is much nicer than the interface of a traditional health insurance.You get a modern dashboard where you can control and view all your health expenses, a mobile app and good customer support. You can also add life insurance from CNP Assurances from the same interface.This simple promise seems to be working quite well as Alan now covers 7,000 employees across 850 companies. As you can see, the startup has been focusing on small companies as it\u2019s easier to make them switch.Alan co-founder and CEO Jean-Charles Samuelian also told me that small companies are underserved by big insurance companies. There\u2019s no reason you should pay more because you work for a small company.With today\u2019s funding round, Alan wants to offer the same product at scale. The company plans to grow from 22 employees right now to 80 employees by December 2018.\u201cThe goal is to reach \u20ac100 million in annual recurring revenue as quickly as possible,\u201d Samuelian told me. The startup currently generates between \u20ac5 and \u20ac6 million in annual recurring revenue.Eventually, Alan wants to expand beyond France and address other European markets. While the U.S. seems like a big market, it\u2019s already quite crowded. Samuelian thinks there will be a bigger opportunity by building a European company. It\u2019ll take quite a bit of time as regulation is different in each European country.Recently, Alan has been focused on building a solid infrastructure, optimizing processes and automating tasks. In many ways, Samuelian still thinks about Alan as a tech company. \u201cWe want to build the Apple or Google of Europe,\u201d he said.Alan can beat competitors on price and flexibility by building a tech product that actually works \u2014 that\u2019s how you can serve 7,000 people with a lean team.Disclosure: I share a personal connection with an executive at CNP Assurances.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/alan-raises-28-3-million-for-its-health-insurance-of-the-future/"},
{"title": ["Facebook demands ID verification for big Pages, \u2018issue\u2019 ad buyers"], "text": "Facebook  is looking to self-police by implementing parts of the proposed Honest Ads Act before the government tries to regulate it. To fight fake news and election interference, Facebook will require the admins of popular Facebook Pages and advertisers buying political or \u201cissue\u201d ads on \u201cdebated topics of national legislative importance\u201d like education or abortion to verify their identity and location. Those that refuse, are found to be fraudulent or are trying to influence foreign elections will have their Pages prevented from posting to the News Feed or their ads blocked.Meanwhile, Facebook plans to use this information to append a \u201cPolitical Ad\u201d label and \u201cPaid for by\u201d information to all election, politics and issue ads. Users can report any ads they think are missing the label, and Facebook will show if a Page has changed its name to thwart deception. Facebook started the verification process this week; users in the U.S. will start seeing the labels and buyer info later this spring, and Facebook will expand the effort to ads around the world in the coming months.This verification and name change disclosure process could prevent hugely popular Facebook Pages from being built up around benign content, then sold to cheats or trolls who switch to sharing scams or misinformation.Overall, it\u2019s a smart start that comes way too late. As soon as Facebook started heavily promoting its ability to run influential election ads, it should have voluntarily adopted similar verification and labeling rules as traditional media. Instead, it was so focused on connecting people to politics, it disregarded how the connection could be perverted to power mass disinformation and destabilization campaigns.\u201cThese steps by themselves won\u2019t stop all people trying to game the system. But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads,\u201d CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. \u201cElection interference is a problem that\u2019s bigger than any one platform, and that\u2019s why we support the Honest Ads Act. This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online.\u201d You can see his full post below.The move follows Twitter\u2019s November announcement that it too would label political ads and show who purchased them.Facebook also gave a timeline for releasing both its tools for viewing all ads run by Pages and to create a Political Ad Archive. A searchable index of all ads with the \u201cpolitical\u201d label, including their images, text, target demographics and how much was spent on them, will launch in June and keep ads visible for four years after they run. Meanwhile, the View Ads tool that\u2019s been testing in Canada will roll out globally in June so users can see any ad run by a Page, not just those targeted to them.Facebook announced in October it would require documentation from election advertisers and label their ads, but now is applying those requirements to a much wider swath of ads that deal with big issues impacted by politics. That could protect users from disinformation and divisive content not just during elections, but any time bad actors are trying to drive wedges into society. Facebook wouldn\u2019t reveal the threshold of followers that will trigger Pages needing verification, but confirmed it will not apply to small to medium-size businesses.By self-regulating, Facebook may be able to take the wind out of calls for new laws that apply to online ads buyer disclosure rules on TV and other traditional media ads. Zuckerberg will testify before the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11. Having today\u2019s announcement to point to could give him more protection against criticism during the hearings, though Congress will surely want to know why these safeguards weren\u2019t in place already.For more on Facebook\u2019s recent troubles, check out our feature stories:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-demands-id-verification-for-big-pages-issue-ad-buyers/"},

It\u2019s a big part of the reason we\u2019ve been seeing the technology start to take off in the home, where people feel a little less self-conscious talking to their machines. The advent of some sort of nonverbal device that gets the job done in a similar way, but without the talking, is a kind of inevitability. A team at MIT has been working on just such a device, though the hardware design, admittedly, doesn\u2019t go too far toward removing that whole self-consciousness bit from the equation.AlterEgo is a headmounted \u2014 or, more properly, jaw-mounted \u2014 device that\u2019s capable of reading neuromuscular signals through built-in electrodes.

Once calibrated, the research team says it was able to get around 92 percent accuracy for commands \u2014 which, honestly, doesn\u2019t seem too far off from the accuracy of voice commands for the assistants I\u2019ve used. The potential for such a device seems clear from a consumer standpoint \u2014 once you get past the creepiness of the whole reading words in your head bit. And the fact that it looks like a piece of medieval orthodontic equipment.

At Future Ventures, we will support those passionate founders.\u201dJurvetson\u2019s fast return to the venture scene isn\u2019t a complete surprise.

So, over the past three years, the Department of Energy  has hosted a Cyber Defense Competition to encourage university students to engage in the field. The latest incarnation of the completion was held this past weekend and hosted by Argonne, Pacific Northwest and Oak Ridge national laboratories.Lewis University won the competition this year in a total field of 25 entrants. That is up from 15 teams last year, and 9 teams in the inaugural competition.Nate Evans leads the program at Argonne, and explained to me the design of the competition. Teams get a month before the competition to learn how to defend industrial control systems against hackers. Each team is given a small industrial control system that emulates a real-world model.Then on the day of the competition, those teams compete and run the operations of the model infrastructure as the cyber defense team. A red team cell tries to hack the system, while a green team of regular, nontechnical people do the normal work of using the system, such as answering emails or responding to requests.Evans explained that they \u201cadd in the usability piece as well, so they\u2019re not just trying to defend against the red team but keeping usability.\u201d Six times an hour, a request to the team comes in, such as a new feature desired by the CEO. The idea is to simulate as closely as possible the conditions of a real piece of industrial infrastructure and forcing the team to project manage different priorities.Teams are allowed to build anything they want to defend their system. \u201cWe try to make it as flexible as possible and so they can bring whatever skills they have,\u201d Evans said. We want the teams to \u201ccome out and try new things such as a custom operating system that they wrote in the class,\u201d he explained, \u201cor some crazy firewall or setup or design.\u201dBecause each of the three labs hosting the competition is on ES Net, the Energy Sciences Network that connects all labs in the U.S., the competition can be conducted in real-time across all locations, and lasts about eight hours.

{"title": ["Facebook reportedly suspends AggregateIQ over connection to improper data-sharing"], "text": "AggregateIQ, a Canadian advertising tech and audience intelligence company, has been suspended by Facebook  for allegedly being closely connected with SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, reported the National Observer.News broke late last month that AIQ, which was deeply involved with (and handsomely paid by) pro-Leave Brexit groups, was not the independent Canadian data broker it claimed to be. Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower who blew the lid off the Cambridge Analytica story, explained it candidly to The Guardian:AIQ has maintained that it has operated independently. Dogged denials appear on its webpage:But the reporting in the Guardian makes these claims hard to take seriously. For instance, a founding member was listed on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s website as working at \u201cSCL Canada,\u201d the company had no website or phone number of its own for some time, and until 2016, AIQ\u2019s only client was Cambridge Analytica. It really looks as if AIQ is simply a Canadian shell under which operations could be said to be performed independent of CA and SCL.Whatever the nature of the connection, it was convincing enough for Facebook to put them in the same bucket.

There have been a number of proposals and ideas for doing it and I think unless [Zuckerberg] finds a way to honor the promise he made several years ago, he\u2019s gonna have a law on his hands.\u201dThe Senator added that he would support such a law.For Wyden, concealing the truth about data sharing in the fine print is a deceptive practice that\u2019s gone on too long.\u201cI think we got to establish a principle once and for all that you own your data, period,\u201d Wyden said.\u201cWhat does that mean in the real world?

{"title": ["Shine Together aims to shine a light on women, and the women behind them"], "text": "Behind every great woman, there is often another great woman who has encouraged her and listened to her and advised her, rather than tried to compete with her. That\u2019s the way that it should be, according to Shine Theory, a concept that was crystalized by journalist Ann Friedman in 2013 and embraced by women in the last presidential administration at the urging of Barack Obama himself.As Obama\u2019s former senior advisor Valerie Jarrett  recalls its genesis in the White House, numerous women who\u2019d been hired into the largely male administration began voicing their opinions less and less over time. \u201cYou had to really push your idea in, and [it was] totally exhausting,\u201d Jarrett recalls in a new interview with the founder of TaskRabbit, Leah Busque .Jarrett \u2014 who\u2019d recruited many of the female senior officials and knew they were the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d \u2014 felt responsible for their happiness, so she voiced her concern. \u201cI said to President Obama, \u2018Watch and see. These women aren\u2019t talking as much as they did at the beginning; they\u2019re shying away.'\u201dIn response, he proposed an idea. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want them to come over and have dinner with me at my home and we\u2019re going to talk about it,'\u201d says Jarrett. They did, and it was a \u201cfrank and open dinner, and everyone explained to him their perspective, and he said, \u2018I have your back. And when I\u2019m not there, Valerie has your back.'\u201dObama then asked the women to commit to having dinner regularly with Jarrett and to come back if they felt they needed to speak with him again. They didn\u2019t, says Jarrett. Over the dinners, she tells Busque, \u201cWe\u2019d built our own community.\u201d Attendees aired grievances about the male colleagues. They discussed their children. They found \u201csafety in numbers,\u201d says Jarrett. Most importantly, she says, they found strength that they carried into their work.Little wonder that Busque, whose company sold to Ikea last year and who today works as a venture capitalist, now wants to help women across a broad range of industries more easily come together to learn, to laugh, and to amplify each other\u2019s power.Toward that end, Busque has formed a new initiative called Shine Together with Task Rabbit\u2019s former VP of marketing, Jamie Viggiano, that plans to organize dinners with women, feature content at its site like Busque\u2019s sit-down with Jarrett, and to help up-and-coming businesswomen connect with needed mentors.The organization, which quietly announced itself on Medium a few weeks ago, has already launched with a series of stories focused on notable women, including Jarrett; five-time Olympic medalist Nastia Liukin; and Ann Miura-Ko, the cofounding partner of the venture firm Floodgate.Shine Together doesn\u2019t merely feature women discussing their own paths, notably. It asks them to \u201cshine a light on women who are behind the scenes but doing incredible stuff,\u201d says Busque. Liukin, for example, talks in her interview about her mother. Miura-Ko talks about a sales executive, Stephanie Schatz, and their relationship.For now, such video interviews will be published weekly and featured at Shine Together\u2019s dedicated site. Over time, Viggiano \u2014 who is running the organization\u2019s day-to-day operations \u2014 intends to work with distribution partners that are interested in making the content a part of their platforms, too.As for the dinners, the idea is for powerful women to come and to bring a plus one \u2014 \u201csomeone who wouldn\u2019t have access to this type of group,\u201d Busque says. \u201cWe want to cast a wider net and give more women who deserve it [entr\u00e9e] into these networking groups.\u201dIt\u2019s still early days, but you can learn more about the initiative here.

Higher Ground Labs seeks to \u201csupercharge\u201d political startups with progressive causes at heart. The incubator and accelerator\u2019s main cause is notching Democratic wins, from local to federal elections.The group just announced a class of 13 politics-minded companies offering \u201cinnovative solutions\u201d to get Democrats elected. The 13 new companies join 10 companies from Higher Ground\u2019s 2017 class.

{"title": ["Why 2018 will be the year apps go to the edge"], "text": "If you\u2019re running a software company today, it\u2019s almost a foregone conclusion that most or all of your apps will run in the cloud. Likely Amazon or Google\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to imagine that this wasn\u2019t always the case, but there are still some late adopters migrating their own physical data centers into managed ones. And, as with all trends in technology, this too shall pass. Just when you were getting comfortable with containers and auto-scaling, a new architecture emerges, swinging the pendulum back to a truly distributed world.A typical self-driving car generates up to 100MB of data per second from a combination of cameras, LIDARs, accelerometers and on-board computers. That data needs to be processed nearly instantly to keep the car on the road. With so much data to sift through, the current generation of cellular networks can\u2019t keep up. By the time data arrives in the cloud, it will be too late. Instead, data needs to be processed as close to the sensors as possible, directly at the edge of networks, on the cars themselves.Most of us aren\u2019t building or riding in self-driving cars (yet), but there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019re already interacting with edge computing every day. Neural networks in smart speakers in almost\u00a040 million American homes are listening for words like \u201cAlexa,\u201d \u201cSiri\u201d or \u201cGoogle\u201d and, according to Statista, 3 billion Snapchats are scanned for faces each day in order to add the addicting face filters. By the end of the year, 20 percent of smartphones globally will have hardware-accelerated machine learning capabilities.All of these apps and devices are made possible by two major trends: advances in deep learning algorithms that help computers see, hear and understand and the proliferation of specialized processors like GPUs and TPUs that can run these algorithms efficiently, even in mobile environments.Neural networks and deep learning aren\u2019t new. In fact, the first artificial neural networks were created in the 1950s, and there have been multiple false starts since.This time, though, the abundance of labeled training data and compute power made it feasible to train these large models. Though AI research is still proceeding at a breakneck pace, fields like computer vision are starting to mature. Developers can choose from a variety of standardized model architectures, publicly available training data sets and tools. You no longer need a PhD just to get started. Technology is being democratized.Hardware is catching up, fast. Machine learning algorithms like neural networks are really just long sequences of matrix multiplications. Specialized processors like GPUs and newer neural processing units like those in Apple\u2019s A11 Bionic chip and Google\u2019s Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are optimized for exactly these mathematical operations, offering 10-100x speedups over traditional CPUs while using less power overall. As major chip manufacturers roll out mobile-ready machine learning accelerators, every device will soon have the power to run the latest AI models.Big data, data science, machine learning and now deep learning have been slowly weaving their way into products and companies for the past decade. Most of the time, this happened behind the scenes, up in the cloud. Data warehouses and analytics pipelines process records en masse. Results are made accessible to end users through APIs and database queries. That\u2019s not going away, but the edge presents a new opportunity to use the predictive capabilities of machine learning models more quickly.Now, the algorithms move to the data. Information is processed in real time, as soon as it\u2019s captured by the sensor, and results are available immediately. In this latency-free world, entirely new user experiences are possible. Your phone\u2019s screen becomes a portal to a world of augmented reality. Products can be personalized for a single user while private data never leaves the device. Applications become ambient and frictionless, anticipating questions and answering them before you ask.When done right, experiences made with AI and edge computing feel like magic, but building them is incredibly complex. There is a divide between the tech stacks used to train and deploy machine learning models in the cloud and the ones used to build applications for edge devices, like smartphones and IoT. Neural networks can replace thousands of lines of procedural code, but fail in unexpected, silent ways and need to be tested differently. Performance issues that can be solved by simply adding more compute or memory from a near infinite cloud call for specialized optimization when they occur out on edge devices we don\u2019t control. Even the programming languages preferred by the cloud are different than those running applications on mobile devices.This is starting to change. Tools and hardware are improving so quickly it\u2019s hard to keep up. Heavyweights like Apple and Google have made mobile machine learning frameworks (Core ML and TensorFlow Lite, respectively) centerpieces of their latest developer offerings. More export options and better interoperability are being added to tools like AWS\u2019s SageMaker, Azure\u2019s ML Studio and IBM\u2019s Watson Studio weekly.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/why-2018-will-be-the-year-apps-go-to-the-edge/"},
{"title": ["Trump should invest in Amazon, not destroy it"], "text": "For those who live under a rock (which, these days, I would recommend), President Donald Trump has become increasingly belligerent toward Amazon  and its founder, Jeff Bezos.In addition to a sequence of tweets against the e-commerce and cloud giant, Gabriel Sherman reported in Vanity Fair yesterday that \u201cNow, according to four sources close to the White House, Trump is discussing ways to escalate his Twitter attacks on Amazon to further damage the company. \u2018He\u2019s off the hook on this. It\u2019s war,\u2019 one source told me. \u2018He gets obsessed with something, and now he\u2019s obsessed with Bezos,\u2019 said another source. \u2018Trump is like, how can I fuck with him?\u2019\u201d\u201cHow can I fuck with them?\u201d also could describe America\u2019s backwards approach to its flagging prowess in critical technology fields, policies that stand in stark contrast to the massive and focused investment of strategic adversaries like China.Through its Made in China 2025 plan, China is putting in place a series of initiatives to dominate the future of technologies like 5G wireless networking, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, biotechnology and semiconductors. It is working to raise about $36 billion for a new semiconductor fund, potentially spend $411 billion on 5G infrastructure, and create a massive domestic market for overseas stocks through Chinese Depositary Receipts.China selects, grows, and champions a set of winners in each industry in order to concentrate resources and increase the probability of success globally for its chosen companies. As Antonio Graceffo described in Foreign Policy Journal, \u201cNational champions are companies which help further the government\u2019s strategic aims and in return, the government supports these companies by providing easier access to financing, giving preference in government contract bidding, and sometimes oligarchy or monopoly status in protected industries, giving these companies a number of advantages over their competitors.\u201dOne has to look no further than Huawei to see the benefits of these policies. Huawei was an unknown player when it started roughly three decades ago, but through an aggressive expansion plan and a wellspring of government support, it has emerged to be the single largest manufacturer of telecommunications networking equipment in the world, surpassing Ericsson back in 2012. The company had revenues of $92 billion last year, and it is taking an early lead in the 5G wireless standards race, which could give it a powerful position to shape the future of connectivity in the years to come.Meanwhile, the leadership of the United States is increasingly targeting the tech sector \u2014 one of the few areas of true vibrancy in the American economy \u2014 and trying to undermine it at every turn. The Trump administration has announced tariffs on high-tech goods that will end up harming U.S. technology exports, rolled back net neutrality legislation and now is talking out loud about breaking up Amazon through antitrust laws.On the latter, it\u2019s not just Trump calling for war against America\u2019s tech leaders: there is a growing movement against companies like Google and Apple which has led to increasing calls for antitrust action from both right-wing and left-wing policy analysts.There are good reasons to be concerned about market dominance \u2014 it limits consumer choice and often increases prices. However, there are obvious limitations on how many competitors can enter markets like wireless infrastructure and cloud computing. The upfront costs are exorbitant \u2014 just launching a single data center today can easily cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more, and conducting original R&D in a competitive industry like artificial intelligence is equally expensive when a machine learning expert can go for tens of millions of dollars.We are never going to have five Googles, nor five Dropboxes or five Amazons \u2014 the economics in these markets just don\u2019t work that way. Their scale is what allows them to offer such comprehensive services at such low cost to consumers. Knocking out Apple is really opening the American market to the next four smartphone manufacturers, which would be Asian manufacturers like Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo and Xiaomi. That sounds like a Pyrrhic victory to me.The U.S. believes in the power of free markets to cull losers and ensure winners a fair return, and the government avoids picking \u201cwinners\u201d as a matter of course in its industrial policy. That worked great when the American economy was dominant, but it is no longer tenable in a world where strategic adversaries are putting their full weight behind a handful of companies.So instead of getting on The Twitter and blasting Amazon, maybe this administration should start to consider that Amazon\u2019s size and dominance in ecommerce and cloud services is actually an incredible blessing of American capitalism. Maybe it should start to think about how the government could assist Amazon in capturing more overseas markets, ensuring that the wealth generated by the company continues to return to its home country.The threats faced by American tech companies parallel similar fears during the 1980s, when Japan\u2019s resurgence on the world stage captivated the attention of U.S. politicians. China, though, is nearly 11 times the population of Japan, and has already overtaken the U.S. economy by some measures. This time really is very different, and the free market needs defenders. Ironically, that means backing American tech giants globally against their competitors.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/trump-should-invest-in-amazon-not-destroy-it/"},

It was a down day on the stock market, but at a $26.5 billion market cap, it\u2019s up from the private market trading that happened in the months leading up to the IPO.The top end of that range, $132, was used as a \u201creference point,\u201d valuing the company at $23.5 billion. Because there was no IPO price, that demarcation is being used to say that Spotify traded up about 13 percent on its first day.Yet while it achieved a desirable market cap, some on Wall Street are puzzled as to why Spotify would want to go public without raising money.One myth that\u2019s been floating around is that Spotify did this to avoid paying bankers. In fact, they worked with Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co. in the lead up to the debut.They did not eliminate the investment banks, but they did manage to avoid the dreaded \u201clock-up\u201d expiration, which is when most employees and insiders are allowed to sell shares.

Chen invested in Spotify when he was at Kleiner Perkins. He believes that \u201cthe price is as real an expression of the value of the company as possible, which makes it an interesting case study for future companies moving into the public markets.\u201dApart from the change in process, this debut also felt different from IPOs because there was no celebration. There was no bell-ringing ceremony and no Spotify employees were present to cheer from the floor.Outside the New York Stock Exchange, there was a Spotify banner to commemorate the event.

The accounts had spent a combined $167,000 on ads since the start of 2015.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote that since discovering the IRA\u2019s election interference efforts, \u201cwe have improved our techniques to prevent nation states from interfering in foreign elections, and we\u2019ve built more advanced AI tools to remove fake accounts more generally.\u201d He went on to detail how Facebook is half-way to its promise to double its security and content review staff from 10,000 to 20,000 this year, with 15,000 now working on the efforts at Facebook.\u201cThese efforts have all made it harder for nation states to interfere in foreign elections\u201d Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook. \u201cWith today\u2019s update, we have now identified a large network the IRA is using to manipulate people in Russia itself. This is the next step towards removing them from Facebook entirely.\u201dBy detailing the specifics of its efforts rather than dragging its feet or waiting for government inquiries, Facebook may be able convince people it\u2019s not asleep at the wheel of its social network.Facebook at first said just 10 million users had seen ads bought by the IRA, but later explained that when organic un-paid posts were counted, 126 million people had seen the propaganda group\u2019s Facebook posts and another 20 million had seen its Instagram posts. Facebook previously shut down the IRA\u2019s 170 Instagram accounts that had shared 120,000 pieces of propaganda and 120 Facebook Page that had shared 80,000 pieces of content.The trickle of information and initial low-ball numbers made it seem like Facebook was trying to downplay the severity of platform abuse. But in recent weeks since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, Facebook has seemed increasingly transparent and receptive to criticism. It seems the convergence of bad news has truly shaken Facebook awake.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/facebook-russia/"},
{"title": ["Where\u2019s the beef? For Impossible Foods it\u2019s in boosting burger sales and raising hundreds of millions"], "text": "Any company that\u2019s looking to replace the more than 5 billion pounds of ground beef making its way onto tables in the U.S. every year with a meatless substitute is going to need a lot of cash.It\u2019s a big vision with lots of implications for the world \u2014 from climate change and human health to challenging the massive, multi-billion dollar industries that depend on meat \u2014 and luckily for Impossible Foods  (one of the many companies looking to supplant the meat business globally), the company has managed to attract big-name investors with incredibly deep pockets to fund its meatless mission.In the seven years since the company raised its first $7 million investment from Khosla Ventures, Impossible Foods has managed to amass another $389 million in financing \u2014 most recently in the form of a convertible note from the Singaporean global investment powerhouse Temasek (which is backed by the Singaporean government) and the Chinese investment fund Sailing Capital (a state-owned investment fund backed by the Communist Party-owned Chinese financial services firm, Shanghai International Group).\u201cPart of the reason why we did this as a convertible note is that we knew we would increase our valuation with the launch of our business,\u201d says David Lee, Impossible Foods chief operating officer. \u201cWe closed $114 million in the last 18 months.\u201d The company raised its last equity round of $108 million in September 2015.Lee declined to comment on the company\u2019s path to profitability, valuation or revenues.Impossible began selling its meat substitute back in 2016 with a series of launches at some of America\u2019s fanciest restaurants in conjunction with the country\u2019s most celebrated young chefs.David Chang (of Momofuku fame in New York) and Traci Des Jardins of Jardini\u00e9re and\u00a0Chris Cosentino\u00a0of Cockscomb signed on in San Francisco, as well as Tal Ronnen of Crossroads in Los Angeles.\u201cWhen we launched a year ago, we were producing out of a pilot facility,\u201d says Impossible co-founder Pat Brown. [Now] we have a full-fledged production facility producing 2.5 million pounds per month at the end of the year.\u201dThe new facility, which opened in Oakland last year, has its work cut out for it. Impossible has plans to expand to Asia this year and is now selling its meat in more than 1,000 restaurants around the U.S.Some would argue that the meat substitute has found its legs in the fast-casual restaurant chains that now dot the country, serving up mass-marketed, higher price point gourmet burgers.\u00a0Restaurants including FatBurger, Umami Burger, Hopdoddy, The Counter, Gott\u2019s and B Spot \u2014 the Midwest burger restaurant owned by Chef Michael Symon \u2014 all hawk Impossible\u2019s meat substitute in an increasing array of combinations.\u201cWhen we started looking at what Pat and the team at Impossible was doing we saw a perfect fit with the values and mission that Impossible has to drive a stronger mindset around what it is to be conscientious about what is going on,\u201d says Umami Burger chief executive\u00a0Daniel del Olmo.Since launching their first burger collaboration last year, Umami Burger has sold more than 200,000 Impossible Burgers. \u201cOnce people tried the burger they couldn\u2019t believe that it was not meat,\u201d says del Olmo. \u201cThey immediately understood that it was a product that they could crave. We are seeing 38 percent increase in traffic leading to 18 percent sales growth [since selling the burger].\u201dAt $13 a pop, the Impossible Umami Burger is impossible for most American families to afford, but pursuing the higher end of the market was always the initial goal for Impossible\u2019s founder, Patrick Brown.A former Stanford University professor and a serial entrepreneur in the organic food space (try his non-dairy yogurts and cheeses!), Brown is taking the same path that Elon Musk used to bring electric vehicles to the market. If higher-end customers with discerning palates can buy into meatless burgers that taste like burgers, then the spending can subsidize growth (along with a few hundred million from investors) to create economics that will become more favorable as the company scales up to sell its goods at a lower price point.Brown recognizes that 2.5 million pounds of meat substitute is no match for a 5 billion-pound ground-beef juggernaut, but it is, undeniably, a start. And as long as the company can boost sales for the companies selling its patties, the future looks pretty bright. \u201cTo get to scale you have to sell to a higher price-point,\u201d says Brown.That approach was the opposite tack from Beyond Meat, perhaps the only other well-funded competitor for the meatless crown. Beyond Meat is selling through grocery stores like Whole Foods, in addition to partnerships of its own with chains like TGIFridays and celebrity backers like Leonardo DiCaprio.\u201cFrom a brand-building standpoint it would have been insane for us to launch in supermarkets given that we had the opportunity to launch with great companies like Umami and great chefs like Dave Chang,\u201d says Brown.\u00a0At the heart of the Impossible Food\u2019s meatless revolution is the development of a vegetable-based heme molecule.Heme is present in most living things and, according to Impossible Foods, it\u2019s the molecule that gives meat its flavor. The company says that it\u2019s the presence of the heme molecule in muscle that makes meat taste like meat. Impossible Foods engineers and ferments yeast to produce that heme protein naturally found in plants, called soy leghemoglobin.\u201cIt\u2019s the iron-containing molecule that carries oxygen in the blood\u2026 what makes meat red or pink\u2026 It\u2019s essential for every living cell on earth,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThe thing that we discovered was that pretty much the entire flavor experience of meat that distinguishes it from all other foods is due to heme. Heme transforms fatty acids into the bloody flavored odorant molecules, and when you cook meat, the protein that holds the meat at a certain temperature unfolds and lets loose.\u201dBrown says Impossible Foods can make fish flavors, chicken flavors and pork flavors, but is going to stick to ground beef for the foreseeable future.The next trick for the company is to manipulate the flavor profile of its meat substitute so its burgers can win in blind taste tests against any other combination of meat patty.\u201cThe company\u2019s mission is to completely replace animals in the food system by 2035,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThe only way to do it is to do a better job than any animal at producing the most nutritious, delicious, affordable and versatile foods. And it will be a very interesting proof of concept landmark when we have a burger that is \u2014 for flavor and deliciousness \u2014 the best burger on earth\u2026 that\u2019s going to send a very important signal to the world.\u201dIf Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat or any of their competitors that are working on developing cultured meat cells in a lab are successful, it has huge implications for the world.These lab-grown meats and meat substitutes could use up to 75 percent less water, generate 87 percent fewer greenhouse gases and require 95 percent less land than what\u2019s used for meat production.Those statistics have attracted investors like the Open Philanthropy Project, Temasek, Bill Gates and Horizons Ventures (backed by the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka Shing). Those billionaire backers have invested in multiple rounds of funding for the company, alongside other early financiers, including Google Ventures, UBS and Viking Global Investors.\u201cThe fundamental economics are so much more favorable for us than for the cow,\u201d says Brown.\u00a0Those economics could also be compelling for potential meat production partners, he says. Brown envisions a potential future where production facilities that use fermentation processes could be used to manufacture the company\u2019s ingredients to get to scale. \u201cIn order to scale rapidly we didn\u2019t want to have to build the entire supply chain from the farm up.\u201dGiven that the main ingredients are wheat, potato and the manufactured heme protein, there\u2019s a chance that the company could actually create an alternative supply chain to the meat packers, butchers and slaughterhouses that dominate the landscape.The meat industry has taken notice and is beginning to push back.According to a report in USA Today, the U.S. Cattlemen\u2019s association filed a 15-page petition with the U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this year calling for an official definition of the terms \u201cbeef\u201d and \u201cmeat.\u201d\u201cWhile at this time alternative protein sources are not a direct threat to the beef industry, we do see improper labeling of these products as misleading,\u201d said Lia Biondo, the association\u2019s policy and outreach director, in a statement. \u201cOur goal is to head off the problem before it becomes a larger issue.\u201dFor Brown, it\u2019s another step along the road of how humans sustain themselves. \u201cPeople act as if science and technology have been outside of the food system,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole food system is a combination of nature and science that makes the food that we eat come into being.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/wheres-the-beef-for-impossible-foods-its-in-boosting-burger-sales-and-raising-hundreds-of-millions/"},

And the marine shipping industry \u2014 one of the oldest industries in the world, you can imagine \u2014 is ready for it. Or at least two major Norwegian shipping companies are: they\u2019re building an autonomous shipping venture called Massterly from the ground up.\u201cMassterly\u201d isn\u2019t just a pun on mass; \u201cMaritime Autonomous Surface Ship\u201d is the term Wilhelmson and Kongsberg coined to describe the self-captaining boats that will ply the seas of tomorrow.These companies, with \u201ca combined 360 years of experience\u201d as their video put it, are trying to get the jump on the next phase of shipping, starting with creating the world\u2019s first fully electric and autonomous container ship, the Yara Birkeland. It\u2019s a modest vessel by shipping terms \u2014 250 feet long and capable of carrying 120 containers according to the concept \u2014 but will be capable of loading, navigating and unloading without a crew(One assumes there will be some people on board or nearby to intervene if anything goes wrong, of course. Why else would there be railings up front?)Each has major radar and lidar units, visible light and IR cameras, satellite connectivity and so on.Control centers will be on land, where the ships will be administered much like air traffic, and ships can be taken over for manual intervention if necessary.At first there will be limited trials, naturally: the Yara Birkeland will stay within 12 nautical miles of the Norwegian coast, shuttling between Larvik, Brevik and Her\u00f8ya. It\u2019ll only be going 6 knots \u2014 so don\u2019t expect it to make any overnight deliveries.\u201cAs a world-leading maritime nation, Norway has taken a position at the forefront in developing autonomous ships,\u201d said Wilhelmson group CEO Thomas Wilhelmson in a press release. \u201cWe take the next step on this journey by establishing infrastructure and services to design and operate vessels, as well as advanced logistics solutions associated with maritime autonomous operations. Massterly will reduce costs at all levels and be applicable to all companies that have a transport need.\u201dThe Yara Birkeland is expected to be seaworthy by 2020, though Massterly should be operating as a company by the end of the year.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/massterly-aims-to-be-the-first-full-service-autonomous-marine-shipping-company/"},
{"title": ["Under a millimeter wide and powered by light, these tiny cameras could hide almost anywhere"], "text": "As if there weren\u2019t already cameras enough in this world, researchers created a new type that is both microscopic and self-powered, making it possible to embed just about anywhere and have it work perpetually. It\u2019s undoubtedly cool technology, but it\u2019s probably also going to cause a spike in tinfoil sales.Engineers have previously investigated the possibility of having a camera sensor power itself with the same light that falls on it. After all, it\u2019s basically just two different functions of a photovoltaic cell \u2014 one stores the energy that falls on it while the other records how much energy fell on it.The problem is that if you have a cell doing one thing, it can\u2019t do the other. So if you want to have a sensor of a certain size, you have to dedicate a certain amount of that real estate to collecting power, or else swap the cells rapidly between performing the two tasks.Euisik Yoon and post-doc Sung-Yun Park at the University of Michigan  came up with a solution that avoids both these problems. It turns out that photosensitive diodes aren\u2019t totally opaque \u2014 in fact, quite a lot of light passes right through them. So putting the solar cell under the image sensor doesn\u2019t actually deprive it of light.That breakthrough led to the creation of this \u201csimultaneous imaging and energy harvesting\u201d sensor, which does what it says on the tin.The prototype sensor they built is less than a square millimeter, and fully self-powered in sunlight. It captured images at up to 15 frames per second of pretty reasonable quality:In the paper, the researchers point out that they could easily produce better images with a few tweaks to the sensor, and Park tells IEEE Spectrum that the power consumption of the chip is also not optimized \u2014 so it could also operate at higher framerates or lower lighting levels.Ultimately the sensor could be essentially a nearly invisible camera that operates forever with no need for a battery or even wireless power. Sounds great!In order for this to be a successful spy camera, of course, it needs more than just an imaging component \u2014 a storage and transmission medium are necessary for any camera to be useful. But microscopic versions of those are also in development, so putting them together is just a matter of time and effort.The team published their work this week in the journal IEEE Electron Device Letters.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/under-a-millimeter-wide-and-powered-by-light-these-tiny-cameras-could-hide-almost-anywhere/"},
{"title": ["Alexa\u2019s routines can now play music, podcasts and radio shows"], "text": "Alexa\u2019s routines are getting a musical upgrade. First launched last year, routines allow Alexa device owners to string together a series of actions that kick off with a simple command \u2014 like \u201cgood morning\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m home,\u201d for example. Until today, the feature included support for news, weather, traffic, smart home skills, as well as, more recently, a set of \u201cAlexa says\u201d commands that let you add a little personality to a given routine. Starting today, Alexa can play your favorite music, podcast or radio show in a routine, too.To use the feature, you\u2019ll select an artist, playlist, album or station from your music library or one of the supported streaming services. Currently, the supported services are those that already work with Alexa \u2014 Amazon  Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Saavn, Deezer and TuneIn.Amazon says you\u2019ll also be able to create a volume action to control the audio output on your device.The addition has the potential to make routines more useful for those who like to have music in their home on a more regular basis. For instance, if you like to start your day with a playlist that gives you energy, you could create a \u201cgood morning\u201d routine that turns on your lights and smart coffee maker, then starts playing your favorite upbeat songs.You also could create a routine for relaxing that includes more soothing music or a nighttime routine that locks the door then plays sleep sounds. A party playlist could be included in a routine that puts your smart light bulbs into a flashing disco mode or crazy colors.But music isn\u2019t the only option \u2014 because some of the services support radio shows or podcasts, those can now be integrated into your routines, too. For instance, a \u201cwelcome home\u201d routine could play your daily briefing followed by a podcast or favorite radio show from TuneIn.Although Alexa gained the ability to run routines before its rival, Google Assistant, Google\u2019s version already supports music, podcasts and radio. So Amazon is playing a bit of catch-up here. In addition, Google Assistant routines can also pick up an audiobook where you left off \u2014 that\u2019s oddly not one of Alexa\u2019s routines options today, even though\u00a0Alexa can read to you from your Audible library. Presumably, Audible support in routines is in the works.Music is an increasingly important business for Amazon, so better integration with Alexa makes sense. The company this week told Billboard it now has \u201ctens of millions\u201d of paid customers, confirming earlier reports that it has become the third-largest music service behind Spotify and Apple Music.The ability to customize routines with music and other audio content will be available within the Alexa app for iOS and Android.

{"title": ["Grab delays shuttering Uber app as Singapore probes merger deal"], "text": "Fans of Uber  in Singapore will have a little more time to continue using the app after Grab,  the rival that is acquiring Uber\u2019s business in the region, agreed to extend the life of the app until April 15 while the country\u2019s competition commission reviews the merger deal.Grab had originally intended to close the Uber app by April 8, but that has been delayed in Singapore by one week following a request from the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore\u00a0(CCCS) while it continues to assess the implications of the tie-up.This agreement only covers Singapore, however, so the Uber app will be closed in the seven other countries where it was operational on April 8. Uber Eats is also being transitioned to Grab, as part of its Grab Food platform, and it will be closed at the end of May.Last week, the CCCS\u00a0said it has \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect that the deal may fall foul of section 54 of Singapore\u2019s Competition Act. The organization issued\u00a0an Interim Measures Directions (IMD) to Uber and Grab \u2014 the first of its kind in Singapore \u2014 which instructed both parties to \u201cmaintain pre-transaction independent pricing, pricing policies and product options,\u201d hence the extension of life for Uber\u2019s app.Grab said it had provided an alternative proposal \u201cwhich takes into account our role in Singapore\u2019s vibrant point-to-point transport industry and how Grab serves commuters and drivers,\u201d which the CCCS confirmed that it is reviewing.A Grab spokesperson declined to discuss the details of the proposal with TechCrunch.At this point it is unclear whether the Uber app will get another extension. Assuming that the CCCS doesn\u2019t come to a conclusion within the next week and the IMD remains, then Uber may live on a little longer in Southeast Asia. But, if the commission is ready to move on, then the April 15 close will happen as scheduled.Here\u2019s the key segment of concern to the commission:One major factor is how Grab\u2019s business is viewed.\u00a0The commission defines the space not as ride-hailing \u2014 where Grab would appear to hold a significantly dominant position by acquiring Uber\u2019s business \u2014 but instead as \u201cchauffeured personal point-to-point transport passenger and booking services.\u201dIn that respect, taxi companies in Singapore \u2014 which allow booking by SMS and phone call, and also offer ride-hailing apps in some cases \u2014 may be considered competition which might water down Grab\u2019s market share. Likewise, Grab\u2019s case may be helped by Singapore carpooling service Ryde\u2019s plan to add private car services in an effort to fill some of the gap post-Uber.Here\u2019s Grab statement in full:Note: The original version of this article has been updated to correct that the Uber app will only be extended in Singapore, not across all Southeast Asian markets.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/grab-delays-shuttering-uber-app-in-southeast-asia/"},

Last month, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada\u00a0launched an investigation\u00a0into allegations about unauthorized access and use of Facebook user profiles.\u201cThe two offices decided to jointly investigate these matters as Facebook and AggregateIQ are subject to both\u00a0PIPEDA\u00a0and\u00a0PIPA.\u201dThe statement does not go into any new detail about the investigations as it notes they are ongoing.The OPCC\u2019s Facebook investigation, which was launched on March 20, followed a complaint against the company. Facebook\u00a0has since confirmed that more than 620k Canadian users had their data scraped and passed to CA \u2014 the majority of whom would not have consented or even known their information was being shared in this way.Meanwhile AggregateIQ\u2019s role in the UK\u2019s 2016 Brexit referendum vote has been the subject of increasing scrutiny in the country, following a lengthy investigation by the Observer of London\u00a0looking at links between the various entities involved and how money was spent by different groups campaigning for the UK to leave the European Union.The company received \u00a33.5M from leave campaign groups in the run up to the 2016 referendum, and has been described by leave campaigners as instrumental in securing their win.AggregateIQ is now among 30 companies being investigated by the UK\u2019s data watchdog, the ICO, as part of an ongoing (and now almost year-long) investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes. Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are also part of that probe.Giving an update\u00a0on the investigation yesterday, the ICO said it looking at \u201chow data was collected from a third party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica\u201d.The watchdog secured a warrant to enter and search the London offices of CA last month.The UK\u2019s Electoral Commission is also investigation Brexit campaign spending \u2014 and has previously asked Facebook, Twitter and Google to provide information about ad spending linked to Russia.Earlier this month Facebook revealed it had removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138 Facebook Pages, and 65 Instagram accounts run by the Russian government-connected troll farm the Internet Research Agency.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the now joint Canadian and British Columbian data probe.Facebook is also facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the FTC into the data misuse scandal, among others.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-aggregateiq-now-being-jointly-probed-by-canada-b-c-data-watchdogs/"},

The company is predicting an operating profit of 1.1 trillion KRW ($1.03 billion) on total sales of 15.1 trillion KRW ($14.1 billion) for the quarter.That\u2019s up 20 percent year-on-year and it represents the first time LG has made a profit of over 1 trillion KRW in the first quarter of the financial year.The financial forecasts don\u2019t include in-depth analysis of LG\u2019s divisions \u2014 the full earnings are due later this month \u2014 so we don\u2019t yet know what is driving this record for sure. Carrying on from its Q4 earnings, which helped 2017 become LG\u2019s most-profitable financial year since 2009, we know that the firm\u2019s home appliance and TV divisions were the star performers, while its home entertainment division saw operating income jump 134 percent to hit $345.96 million.LG Mobile is likely to once again drag the numbers down.Its newest device \u2014 the\u00a0V30S ThinQ \u2014 is unlikely to move the needle with consumers as TechCrunch\u2019s Brian Heater noted when he reviewed the device at Mobile World Congress in February.To give credit,\u00a0new LG Mobile CEO\u00a0Hwang Jeong-hwan \u2014 who took the top job in November \u2014 managed to reduce losses from\u00a0375.3 billion KRW ($331.37 million) in Q3 to\u00a0213.2 billion KRW ($192.33 million) in Q4, but turning the division profitable is much harder than cutting the bleeding.LG Mobile has posted just one quarter of profitability over the last two years, that was a small $3.2 million profit Q1 2017, the first quarter of sales of its G6 flagship. Previous to that, you have to go way back to Q1 2015 to find a positive quarter for its mobile division.\u201cDue to the challenging business environment of smartphones, the mobile communications arm is presumed to have not posted a sharp improvement in performances,\u201d NH Investment & Securities said in a note according to Yonhap.That said, the company\u2019s newest flagship phone \u2014 the G7 \u2014 is rumored to be dropping next month, so it won\u2019t be too long before we can see what the new management team has in mind.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/lg-forecasts-record-q1-profit/"},

(His formal title: Member and Head of TMT Growth Equity, where \u201cmember\u201d actually means \u201cpartner,\u201d it turns out.)And what a week it was. There was news aplenty to get through, not the least of which that Spotify\u2019s  shares \u2014 as of airtime, at least \u2014 were being pretty reasonable. After rising sharply above their reference price, they fell some and then recovered a bit on Thursday.That success, to pick a word, you might think would be an inspiration to other startups. However, our\u00a0guest made a good case that the market is not about to see a bunch of other companies follow suit in putting together direct listings. Spotify was a bit of an outlier, it seems.Moving along, we peeked into DocuSign\u2019s latest numbers, which show declining net losses (GAAP, of course), and growing revenue. In short, the firm\u2019s updated numbers that include calendar 2017 (long story, more here) look pretty good, and now DocuSign\u2019s  impending IPO\u2019s only real question left concerns pricing.But there was more to chew on, most especially the recent $2.7 billion buy of Mobike, a heavily-funded Chinese bikeshare\u00a0company. However, how material or real or substantive the deal really was is up for debate. The short riff there is that Tencent, an Internet giant, backed both Mobike,  and its acquirer. So, how much of the deal was cosmetic?And finally, Katie\u2019s piece on a potential Uber-JUMP Bikes tie-up brought us to the domestic bike and scooter market.

Turns out, Zuckerberg will have a busier week in D.C. than expected, with the Senate Judiciary and Senate Commerce Committees announcing a joint hearing with the Facebook  boss.The Senate hearing will go down on April 10, a day before Zuckerberg appears before the House Committee.The hearing, convened by Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), is titled \u201cFacebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data.\u201dThe hearing will take place in the U.S. Capitol Visitors Center at 2:15pm ET.Here\u2019s what Senator Thune had to say in a prepared statement:Zuckerberg brought up the possibility of speaking to congress in late March, saying: \u201cIf it is ever the case that I am the most informed person at Facebook in the best position to testify, I will happily do that.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/zuckerberg-will-also-testify-before-the-senate/"},
{"title": ["Myanmar group blasts Zuckerberg\u2019s claim on Facebook hate speech prevention"], "text": "It\u2019s becoming common to say that Mark Zuckerberg  is coming under fire, but the Facebook  CEO is again being questioned, this time over a recent claim that Facebook\u2019s internal monitoring system is able to thwart attempts to use its services to incite hatred.Speaking to Vox, Zuckerberg used the example of Myanmar, where he claimed Facebook had successfully\u00a0rooted out and prevented hate speech through a system that scans\u00a0chats inside Messenger. In this case, Messenger had been used to send messages to\u00a0Buddhists and Muslims with the aim of creating conflict on September 11 last year.Zuckerberg told Vox:That claim has been rejected in a letter signed by six organizations in Myanmar, including tech accelerator firm Phandeeyar. Far from a success, the group said the incident shows why Facebook is not equipped to respond to hate speech in international markets since it relied entirely on\u00a0information from the ground, where Facebook does not have an office, in order to learn of the issue.The group \u2014 which includes hate speech monitor\u00a0Myanmar ICT for Development Organization and the Center for Social Integrity \u2014\u00a0explained that some four days elapsed between the sending of the first message and Facebook responding with a view to taking action.The group added that it has not had feedback from the Messenger incident, and it is still to hear feedback on ideas raised at its last meeting with Facebook in November.Myanmar has only recently embraced the internet in recent times, thanks to the slashing of the cost of a SIM card \u2014 which was once as much as $300 \u2014 but already most people in the country are online. Since its internet revolution has taken place over the last five years, the level of Facebook adoption per person is one of the highest in the world.\u201cOut of a 50 million population, there are nearly 30 million active users on Facebook every month,\u201d\u00a0Phandeeyar\u00a0CEO Jes Petersen told TechCrunch. \u201cThere\u2019s this notion to many people that Facebook is the internet.\u201dFacebook optimistically set out to connect the world, and particularly facilitate communication between governments and people, so that statistic may appear at face value to fit with its goal of connecting the world, but the platform has been abused in Myanmar.Chiefly that has centered around stoking tension between the Muslim and Buddhist populations in the country.The situation in the country is so severe that an estimated\u00a0700,000 Rohingya refugees are thought to have fled to\u00a0neighboring Bangladesh following a Myanmar government crackdown that began in August. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has\u00a0labeled\u00a0the actions as ethnic cleansing, as has the UN.Tensions inflamed, Facebook has been a primary outlet for racial hatred from high-profile individuals inside Myanmar. One of them, monk\u00a0Ashin Wirathu who is barred from public speaking due to past history, moved online to Facebook where he quickly found an audience. Though he had\u00a0his Facebook account shuttered, he has vowed to open new ones in order to continue to amplifly his voice via the social network.Beyond visible figures, the platform has been ripe for anti-Muslim and anti-Rohinga\u00a0memes and false new stories to go viral.\u00a0UN investigators last month said Facebook has \u201cturned into a beast\u201d and\u00a0played a key role in spreading hate.Petersen said that\u00a0Phandeeyar \u2014 which helped Facebook draft its local\u00a0language\u00a0community standards page \u2014\u00a0and others have held regular information meetings with the social network on the occasions that it has visited Myanmar. But the fact that it does not have an office in the country nor local speakers on its permanent staff has meant that little to nothing has been done.Likewise, there is no organizational structure to handle the challenging situation in Myanmar, with many of its policy team based in Australia, and Facebook itself is not customized to solicit feedback from users in the country.\u201cIf you are serious about making Facebook better, we urge you to invest more into moderation \u2014 particularly in countries, such as Myanmar, where Facebook has rapidly come to play a dominant role in how information is accessed and communicated,\u201d the group wrote.\u201cWe urge you to be more intent and proactive in engaging\u00a0local groups, such as ours, who are invested in finding solutions, and \u2014 perhaps most importantly \u2014 we urge\u00a0you to be more transparent about your processes, progress and the performance of your interventions, so\u00a0as to enable us to work more effectively together,\u201d they added in the letter.Facebook has offices covering five of Southeast Asia\u2019s largest countries\u00a0\u2014 Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines \u2014 and its approach to expansion has seemed to focus on advertising sales opportunities, with most staff in the region being sales or account management personnel. Using that framing,\u00a0Myanmar \u2014 with a nascent online advertising space \u2014 isn\u2019t likely to qualify for an office, but Phandeyaar\u2019s\u00a0Petersen believes there\u2019s a\u00a0strong alternative case.\u201cMyanmar could be a really good test market for how you fix these problems,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe issues are not exclusive to Myanmar, but Facebook is so dominant and there are serious issues in the country \u2014 here is an opportunity to test ways to mitigate hate speech and fake news.\u201dIndeed, Zuckerberg has been praised for pushing to make Facebook less addictive, even at the expense\u00a0of reduced advertising revenue. By the same token, Facebook could sacrifice profit and invest in\u00a0opening more offices worldwide to help live up to the responsibility of being the de facto internet in many countries. Hiring local people to work hand-in-hand with communities would be a huge step forward to addressing these issues.With over $4 billion in profit per quarter, it\u2019s hard to argue that Facebook can\u2019t justify the cost of a couple of dozen people in countries where it has acknowledged that there are local issues. Like the newsfeed changes, there is probably a financially-motivated argument that a safer Facebook is better for business, but the humanitarian responsibility alone should be enough to justify the costs.In a statement, Facebook apologized that Zuckerberg had not acknowledged the role of the local groups in reporting the messages.\u201cWe took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content. We should have been faster and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content,\u201d a spokesperson said.The company said it is rolling a feature to allow Messenger users to report abusive content inside the app. It said also that it has added more Burmese language reviewers to handle content across its services.\u201cThere is more we need to do and we will continue to work with civil society groups in Myanmar and around the world to do better,\u201d the spokesperson added.The company didn\u2019t respond when we asked if there\u00a0are plans to open an office in Myanmar.Zuckerberg\u2019s interview with Vox itself was one of the first steps of a media campaign that the Facebook supremo has embarked on in response to a wave of criticism and controversy that the company has weathered over the way it handles user data.Facebook was heavily criticised last year for allowing Russian parties to disrupt the 2016 U.S. election using its platform, but the drama has intensified in recent weeks.The company\u2019s data privacy policy came under fire after it emerged that a developer named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan used the platform to administer a personality test app that collected data about participants and their friends. That data was then passed to Cambridge Analytica where it may have been leveraged to optimize political campaigns including that of\u00a02016 presidential candidate Donald Trump\u00a0and the Brexit vote, allegations which the company itself vehemently denies. Regardless of how the data was employed to political ends, that lax data sharing was enough to ignite a firestorm around Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.Zuckerberg himself fronted a rare call with reporters this week in which he answered questions on a range of topics, including whether he should resign as Facebook CEO. (He said he won\u2019t.)Most recently, Facebook admitted that as many as 87 million people on the service may have been impacted by Cambridge Analytica\u2019s activities. That\u2019s some way above its initial estimate of 50 million. Zuckerberg is scheduled to appear in front of Congress\u00a0to discuss the affair, and likely a whole lot more, on April 11. The following day, he has a date with the Senate to discuss, we presume, more of the same.Following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the company\u2019s stock dropped\u00a0precipitously,\u00a0wiping more than $60 billion\u00a0off its market capitalization from its prior period of stable growth.Added to this data controversy, Facebook has been found to have deleted messages that Zuckerberg and other senior executives sent to some users, as TechCrunch\u2019s Josh Constine reported this week. That\u2019s despite the fact that Facebook and its Messenger product do not allow ordinary users to delete sent messages from a recipient\u2019s inbox.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/myanmar-group-blasts-zuckerbergs-claim-on-facebook-hate-speech-prevention/"},
{"title": ["Walmart to roll out over 500 more Pickup Towers to U.S. stores this year"], "text": "Walmart  announced this week it\u2019s going to roll out more than 500 additional Pickup Towers to its U.S. stores over the course of the year. The towers, which are like high-tech vending machines distributing customers\u2019 online purchases, were first introduced into nearly 200 stores in 2017.The towers are one of the ways Walmart is taking on Amazon by leveraging its large brick-and-mortar footprint to encourage more sales. The company had also announced last April a \u201cpickup discount\u201d on a million online-only items, if customers opted for store pickup over shipping.The idea is that customers could save more on their orders, then pickup in the store where they might buy more things, while also saving Walmart on shipping expenses. (It costs Walmart less to ship items to its stores using its fleet of over 6,700 trucks and its 4,700 some fulfillment centers, than it does to ship items directly to customers\u2019 homes.)Pickup Towers ties into that discount program, as they\u2019re one of the ways shoppers can retrieve their online purchases faster, and without paying for shipping which could be required for purchases not covered by Walmart\u2019s free 2-day shipping program.To use a Pickup Tower, customers shop online as usual, then wait for the email that says their item is available in the tower at their local store. When they arrive, they scan the barcode they received at the tower\u2019s kiosk computer, and the item is sent down through the tower right to the customer.Walmart says that more than half a million orders have been retrieved through the towers since their introduction last year. Because the program was successful, Walmart will roll out more towers across the U.S., to reach over 700 stores by year-end \u2013 or 40 percent of the U.S. population.In addition, the towers will be gaining a new feature to allow shoppers to pick up larger items, like TVs, which wouldn\u2019t have fit before. Every new Pickup Tower that\u2019s installed will also come with Pickup Lockers, where bigger purchases can be retrieved.Walmart rival Amazon has also had a locker program in place for some time. And with its acquisition of Whole Foods, it began to use the grocer\u2019s stores as a new location for its Amazon Lockers, boosting store visits.Walmart\u2019s Pickup Towers aren\u2019t the only way the retailer is using its stores as a means of serving shoppers with investments in new technology. It also offers online grocery ordering with same-day curbside pickup and \u2013 in some markets \u2013 grocery delivery; along with\u00a0Mobile Express Scan & Go, for skipping the checkout line in stores; and a partnership with Google for voice ordering and Google Express integration.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/walmart-to-roll-out-over-500-more-pickup-towers-to-u-s-stores-this-year/"},
{"title": ["Facebook data scandal also affects 2.7M EU citizens"], "text": "Another data-point to flesh out the Facebook  data misuse scandal: The company has informed the European Commission that a total of 2.7 million EU citizens had their information improperly shared with the controversial political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica (via Reuters).Facebook had already revealed a breakdown of the top ten markets of affected users. But in the list of countries it published the only EU nation was the UK \u2014 which it said could have up to almost 1.08M affected users. So up to a further million EU citizens could also have had their data swiped as a result of the scandal, without their knowledge or consent.Privacy  is a fundamental right under the bloc\u2019s legal regime so the improper sharing of millions of EU citizens\u2019 data could have legal consequences for the company.\u201cFacebook confirmed to us that the data of overall up to 2.7 million Europeans or people in the EU to be more precise may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica . The letter also explains the steps Facebook has taken in response since,\u201d\u00a0an EC spokesman told Reuters.At the time of writing Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment.The company is a signatory to the EU-US Privacy Shield framework; a mechanism which came into force in mid 2016 \u2014 replacing the invalidated Safe Harbor arrangement which had stood for 15 years \u2014 intended to simplify the process of authorizing transfers of EU citizens\u2019 personal data across the Atlantic.Companies on the Privacy Shield list self-certify to adhere to a set of privacy principles. However they can be removed if they are determined to have violated their obligations \u2014 with the US\u2019 FTC acting as the enforcement authority.The same federal watchdog\u00a0is now investigating Facebook as a result of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal.\u00a0 Nor is this the first time the FTC has probed Facebook\u2019s actions in relation to user privacy. In 2011 it charged the company over deceptive privacy claims.In the subsequent FTC settlement\u00a0Facebook committed to giving users \u201cclear and prominent notice\u201d and to obtaining their consent before sharing their information beyond their privacy settings.Facebook will now need to explain to the FTC how its actions in 2013-2015 mesh with that earlier consent agreement.In mid 2015 the company finally tightened app permissions\u2019 settings for all developers on its platform. But prior to that these had been lax enough for vast amounts of personal data to be sucked out without most users being aware \u2014 because the data sharing was being \u2018authorized\u2019 by their Facebook friends (who also likely weren\u2019t aware what they were agreeing to).So, for example, just\u00a0558 Filipino Facebook users installed the personality quiz app that passed data to Cambridge Analytica \u2014 yet the company was able to grab personal data on up to 1,175,312 more users in that country as a result of how Facebook allowed people\u2019s data to be shared with developers on its platform.Yesterday Facebook admitted\u00a0as many as 87 million users\u00a0in total could have had their personal info shared with Cambridge Analytica after 270k people downloaded the quiz app on its platform. (Though CA has disputed the 87M figure, claiming it only licensed data from the quiz app developer for 30M Facebook users.)Writing about the data misuse scandal in the Harvard Law Review, David Vladeck, the FTC\u2019s former director, argues there are now only two interpretations of Facebook\u2019s actions vis-a-vis data protection and user privacy: Cluelessness or venality.\u201cFacebook now has three strikes against it: Beacon, the privacy modifications it made in 2009 to force private user information public, and now the Kogan/Cambridge Analytica revelation,\u201d he writes. \u201cFacebook can\u2019t claim to be clueless about how this happened. The FTC consent decree put Facebook on notice. All of Facebook\u2019s actions were calculated and deliberate, integral to the company\u2019s business model, and at odds with the company\u2019s claims about privacy and its corporate values. So many of the signs of venality are present.\u201d\u201c[V]ague and unenforceable promises are not enough,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe better approach would be for Facebook to acknowledge that it violated the consent decree and to come to the FTC with specific proposals for serious and enduring reform.\u201dIn terms of specific proposals to reform privacy rules,\u00a0Vladeck suggests Facebook needs to create systems that ensure\u00a0third parties do not have access to user data \u201cwithout safeguards that are effective, easy to use, and verifiable\u201d.\u201cWhen third party access is sought, users must be given clear notice and an opportunity to say yes or no \u2013 that is, the gateway must be notice and the affirmative express consent required by the 2011 decree,\u201d he adds. \u201cFacebook also must develop accountability systems that prove that consumers have in fact consented to each use of their data by Facebook or by third parties. And Facebook must agree to refrain from using blanket consents; after all, blanket consents are the enemy of informed consent.\u201dIn his view the company also needs to create systems to audit third party data collection and sharing \u201con an ongoing basis\u201d \u2014 and thereby \u201chold third parties to their promises by engineering controls and contractual lockups\u201d \u2014 including \u201ceffective remedies when third parties break the rules \u2013 including enforceable rights to audit, retrieve, delete and destroy data improperly acquired or used, and liquidated and actual damages for violations\u201d. Rather than taking it on trust that developers given access to masses of user data will do the right thing.\u201cFacebook must also be accountable to the public,\u201d he adds. \u201cThere must be far more robust reporting to the FTC, but those reports are non-public. To re-establish trust with its uses, Facebook should consider appointing a data ombudsperson and establishing a group outside the company that have unfettered access to Facebook data and employees to ensure that Facebook is now, finally, honoring its commitments to users, and this group should periodically report its findings on Facebook\u2019s compliance.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/facebook-data-scandal-eu-citizens/"},

The dashboard also provided a summary of the child\u2019s daily device use, including things like\u00a0what books were read, videos watched, apps or games played, and websites visited, and for how long.According to a research study Amazon commissioned with\u00a0Kelton Global Research, the company found that 97 percent of parents monitor or manage their kids\u2019 use of tablets and smartphones, but 75 percent don\u2019t want to hover over kids when they\u2019re using their devices.On Thursday, Amazon addressed this problem by allowing parents to remotely configure the parental control settings from the online Parent Dashboard in order to manage the child\u2019s device from afar from a phone, tablet or computer.The controls are the same as those available through the child\u2019s device itself. Parents can set a device bedtime, daily goals and time limits, adjust their smart filter, and enable the web browser remotely. They can also remotely add new books, videos, apps and games to their child\u2019s FreeTime profile, and lock or unlock the device for a set period of time.The addition comes following last year\u2019s launch of FreeTime on Android, and Google\u2019s own entry into the parental control software space with the public launch of Family Link last fall. Apple also this year made vague promises about improving its existing parental controls in the future, in response to pressure from two Apple shareholder groups,\u00a0Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System.With the increased activity in the parental control market, Amazon\u2019s FreeTime may lose some of its competitive advantages. Amazon also needed to catch up to the remote control capabilities provided with Google\u2019s Family Link.There are those who argue that parental controls that do things like limit kids\u2019 activity on apps and games or turn off access to the internet are enablers of lazy parenting, where devices instead of people are setting the rules. But few parents use parental controls in that fashion. Rather, they establish house rules then use software to remind children the rules exist and to enforce them.The updated FreeTime Parent Dashboard is available via a mobile-optimized website at\u00a0parents.amazon.com.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-06 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/06/amazon-rolls-out-remote-access-to-its-freetime-parental-controls/"},

NASA  and Lockheed Martin are taking concrete steps toward the creation of jets that travel faster than the speed of sound but are \u201cabout as loud as a car door closing.\u201dNASA announced today that it has awarded Lockheed a juicy $247.5 contract to produce a single \u201cX-plane,\u201d or experimental plane, meeting certain requirements by the end of 2021. The company created a preliminary design under a previous contract.Much of the engineering is up to Lockheed, of course, but in the end the single-pilot craft will travel at some 940 MPH at high altitude \u2014 55,000 feet \u2014 and produce around 75 perceived decibels (compared with the Concorde\u2019s 90) at ground level.Of course it will be louder up close \u2014 you can\u2019t run engines and split the air at that speed without making a racket, and this thing is using a fighter jet engine. A big problem with supersonic flight was that the sonic boom made it too loud to fly over populated areas. (The Concorde had more problems than that, but the boom was part of it.)But there\u2019s been a great deal of research (dramatic NASA video here) into improving the aerodynamics of a supersonic craft and carefully designing every contour to control the inevitable pressure waves it creates. This new plane will be the first to test many of those principles.Once the craft is delivered at the end of 2021, assuming everything plays out according to schedule, NASA will start flight tests and collect community responses. Presumably that means asking if they heard anything unusual that day.That data will be passed on to regulators as support for new rules on supersonic flight \u2014 which could in turn give the aerospace industry the green light to develop practical applications.As you can see there\u2019s a long way to go before a quiet supersonic jet is even built and tested, but the work is underway.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/nasa-grants-lockheed-martin-248m-contract-to-develop-a-quieter-supersonic-jet/"},

{"title": ["Spotify\u2019s missing money-maker is artist-to-fan messaging"], "text": "Streaming royalties are too expensive for Spotify to thrive as a public company just playing us songs. Spotify\u2019s shares closed down 10 percent today during its NYSE trading debut. Luckily it controls much of the relationship between musicians and their fans on its app, poising it to build a powerful revenue and artist loyalty generator by connecting the two through native advertising and messaging that doesn\u2019t stop the music.Spotify  already has a wide range of ad experiences built for traditional brands, from audio ads to display units to sponsored sessions where users get ad-free playback in exchange for watching a commercial. But none of these ad units are designed to help musicians grow their audience within Spotify, even if they can be bent to that purpose.Spotify could win big by following Facebook\u2019s roadmap.Back in 2007, Facebook already had ads that led offsite. Think of these as Spotify\u2019s existing audio and display ads. But when Facebook built Pages that let businesses reach you through the News Feed, it also launched ads that let them promote and grow their Pages within Facebook. Unlike the stock banner ads you see all over the web, these ads were native to Facebook, targeted with its profile data, and they used social referrals about Pages your friends interacted with to rope you in. These gave entities on Facebook a paid way to grow their popularity inside the platform.This is Spotify\u2019s opportunity.A few years ago, Spotify\u2019s user base was too small for artists to focus on spending money there to get popular. But Spotify has grown to the size where it\u2019s replacing top 40 radio, and\u00a0over 30 percent of listening now comes from its recommendations and algorithmic playlists like Discover Weekly. The record labels now need Spotify to have a hit. Between that influence and it\u2019s stature as the biggest on-demand music streaming service, Spotify has the leverage to offer artists the best tool to boost their fan base. Whether artists want to build a following on Spotify, sell collectors\u2019 items, or fill premium front-row seats at their shows, Spotify could hook them up.The no-longer-a-startup has already built the groundwork for this with the launch of its Spotify For Artists analytics dashboard app last year that shows a musician\u2019s top songs, and the demographics of their fans including their location, gender, age, and what else they listen to. Spotify\u2019s proven the power of this data with its Fans First email campaigns that let artists reach their most frequent listeners with access to concert ticket pre-sales and exclusive merchandise. It claims the emails see a\u00a040 percent\u00a0open rate, and 17 percent click-through rate \u2014 way higher than the industry standard.But if Spotify built new surfaces for artists to reach out directly to fans within its apps, it could become the destination for record label marketing money. Since these\u00a0artist ads and messages would all drive users deeper into the app rather than away from it like brand ads, Spotify could charge less than traditional ads and make them affordable to labels on a budget or musicians paying out-of-pocket.Here are some ways Spotify could create native artist-to-fan marketing channels:Sponsored songs on its algorithmic playlists could expose fans to artists in the most natural way possible, or turn one-time listeners into loyalists. Wherever there\u2019s recommendations, there\u2019s room for paid discovery. Listeners could easily skip the track or switch to a different playlist, but might end up falling in love with the band, and diving into their catalogue. It\u2019s the equivalent of Facebook\u2019s in-News Feed native ads, but with a musician promoted instead of a business\u2019 Page. Spotify was actually spotted testing what was effectively a sponsored song in mid-2017 above the start of some playlists. While there was an opt-out option within the app\u2019s Settings that\u2019s since disappeared, Spotify has at least considered this idea.Promoted Artists\u00a0could use a similar model to\u00a0Google\u2019s AdWords sponsored search results. When users search for an artist, they could be shown similar artists who\u2019ve paid to be promoted in the search typeahead or results page. Spotify could also insert a box within the profile of another artist you\u2019re browsing below their top tracks. Spotify already lists a slew of related artists in text, but could highlight one that pays, perhaps showing one of their songs that could be instantly played.Featured Artists\u00a0could give artists that pay a special slot on Spotify\u2019s browse page. With so many recommendations here, it\u2019d be easy to insert a sponsored section without feeling interruptive.Sponsored Visualizations\u00a0could make better use of your screen while you listen. Rather than just staring at the album art and playback controls, Spotify could let artists pitch fans their other music, tickets, gear, or social media channels. Spotify could also fill this space with entertaining silent video clips, photo slideshows, and biographical info as I suggested as a differentiator in 2016, and similar to how lyrics site Genius started doing with its Stories this week. Given users are currently listening to the artist, they might be primed for these experiences. Spotify has already tested letting artists show GIFs during playback, and has partnered with Genius to show Behind The Music factoids, but this is real estate that could help artists earn more money as well as entertain fans.The most ambitious and audacious way to let artists reach fans would be a special artist-to-fan messaging channel. Spotify got rid of its in-app inbox and messaging feature for sending friends songs a few years ago, instead pushing users to share music via their chat app of choice. But similar to the Fans First email campaigns, Spotify could create a special artist-to-fan messaging section in its app that could alert users to new releases and playlists as brand advertising, or even push tours and merchandise as more direct performance advertising.Spotify could give all artists a certain volume of messages they could send for free or let them reach out just to the top 1% of fans a certain number of times per month or year. Then artists could pay to send more messages beyond the limits. Alternatively, it could just charge for any use of messaging.Done wrong, the above options could feel like Spotify gouging artists to reach their own fans. But done right, users might actually enjoy it. These connections wouldn\u2019t be too far off from following an artist on other social media, but where people are already listening. Finding out about one of your favorite band\u2019s new albums, tours, or t-shirts might feel less like an ad and more like an inside tip from the fan club.Spotify might be able to get away with showing some of these different experiences to users who\u2019ve subscribed if they don\u2019t get in the way of music listening. Swinging to the other end of the opportunity spectrum, the company could just give away all these experiences to artists, boosting their loyalty to Spotify and getting them to promote their presence there instead of on competing streaming services like Apple Music.If Spotify doesn\u2019t figure out a way to improve its margins with additional revenue drivers, it may have a tough time surviving as a public company. If it becomes too profitable from just music streaming, the labels can always try to increase their royalty rates. Spotify might hope that more artists work with it directly, cutting out the middlemen, but the record labels still provide some important marketing, radio promotion, and distribution services that artists need. Meanwhile, startups including United Masters (which raised a $70 million Series A from Google parent Alphabet and Andreessen Horowitz) adnd subscription crowdfunding platforms like Patreon want to usurp the record labels and become the way artists earn more before Spotify can.Creating ways to connect with listeners could offer Spotify a way to combat the enduring narrative that it\u2019s screwing over musicians. If Spotify can prove these artist-to-fan messaging options earn them more than they cost, it could be seen as the streaming service that\u2019s actually trying to help musicians make a living.Recorded music has become primarily a promotional tool for all of a musician\u2019s other revenue monetization methods since the dawn of the MP3. Streaming\u2019s on-demand structure and no-extra-cost-per-play nature turns the curious listener who\u2019s only heard of an artist or just likes one single into a diehard fan who shells out the big bucks every time their favorite act is in town.As we shift to an experiential culture where our possessions are digitized and its our interests that define us, people want to feel closer to the creators they love. Artist-to-fan messaging could bring the whole life-cycle from discovery to affinity to real monetization beyond the royalties all within one green and black app.For more on Spotify going public, read our feature stories:\u00a0\u00a0", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/the-rainbow-connection/"},

Meituan Dianping said Mobike will continue as an independent brand with its management team remaining in place. In addition, Meituan CEO\u00a0Xing Wang will become\u00a0Mobike\u2019s chairman.\u201cWe believe that by bringing in Mobike\u2019s resources and expertise to our platform, we further complement our comprehensive local life service platform to help our customers not only \u2018Eat Better\u2019 but also \u2018Live Better\u2019,\u201d Wang said in a statement.Meituan Dianping is best known for food deliveries via electric bike, but that is just one part of its platform which connects local retailers to consumers via a so-called offline to online, or O2O, platform. The company claims to serve 320 million active customers. It\u00a0was formed through a multi-billion dollar merger between China\u2019s largest group buying services\u00a0in 2015 and it has since raised boat-loads of capital from investors, including $4 billion last October, to expand into new areas.Transportation is a major focus for\u00a0Meituan Dianping. The firm began offering ride-hailing services earlier this year and it has invested in Go-Jek in Southeast Asia,\u00a0so adding Mobike to its stables makes perfect sense on that front, not to mention potential synergies with its core delivery business, too.These new forays might lead to an IPO. A host of Chinese firms have jumped into the public markets lately, and Bloomberg recently reported that Meituan Dianping hopes to join them with a listing that could value it as high as $60 billion.The deal will also be a major win for Tencent  against its long-time foe Alibaba.Tencent is an investor in\u00a0Meituan Dianping and Mobike, and unifying the two could help\u00a0Meituan Dianping battle Ele.me, the $9.6 billion delivery service that Alibaba just bought in full last week. Indeed, Caixin reports that Tencent CEO Pony Ma himself brokered the deal.Mobike and Ofo  pioneered bike-sharing in China and the rest of the world. Mobike raised nearly $1 billion from investors that, Tencent aside, include Temasek, Foxconn, Hillhouse Capital and Vertex Ventures.Mobike, which claims 30 million rides per day, has been an investment and acquisition target for many.Last year, a deal to merge with close rival Ofo was widely speculated. Ultimately, reports suggest that it fell through out of fear that Didi Chuxing, the ride-hailing giant that invested in Ofo, would become too powerful if the two bike-sharing firms tied up. That theory seemed to have its merits after Didi rolled out a hostile bike-sharing platform that sits inside its hugely popular ride-hailing app and is aimed at extinguishing the threat of Ofo, Mobike and others by simply turning them into features rather than fully-fledged rivals.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/chinese-bike-sharing-pioneer-mobike-sold-to-ambitious-meituan-dianping-for-2-7b/"},
{"title": ["This new venture fund has more than $180 million to invest in interactive entertainment startups"], "text": "Most brand-new venture funds don\u2019t start life with $180 million in capital commitments, especially if they are launched by people who have not worked as venture capitalists before, and particularly not if those people want to focus narrowly on the global interactive entertainment industry.That Makers Fund is the culmination of all of these things makes it one of the more interesting debut funds about which we\u2019ve heard (and we hear about a lot of new venture funds).We talked earlier this week with firm cofounder Jay\u00a0Chi, who previously spent eleven-and-a-half years at McKinsey & Co., where he says he led its global video games practice. We asked how he and cofounder Michael Cheung \u2014 a McKinsey alum who more recently spent a year as a senior director with Tencent Holdings \u2014\u00a0 managed to put the fund together and what they are aiming to do.TC: You\u2019ve closed on $180 million for your first fund and it\u2019s not even officially closed yet. That\u2019s a pretty big opening statement.JC: We figured if we\u2019re trying to do something, we want enough capital to move the needle. Fifty million for a gaming and interactive entertainment fund isn\u2019t enough. We think the Series A is where you can make the biggest dent.TC: Who are your investors?JC: We\u2019re not allowed to [name] them, but it\u2019s institutions and family offices and high net worth individuals, mostly across Asia, from Japan to Korea.TC: How did you persuade them to invest in you?JC: People in the gaming world know me. I\u2019ve been a whisperer and long-time advisor in this business, helping my friends make a lot of investment decisions at both the early and very late stage. I\u2019ve never been a portfolio manager before, but I\u2019ve seen a lot of successes and failures and I think LPs look at the history of my involvement in industry and also my passion for the industry.TC: Does Michael have any investing experience?JC: He had some investing experience in his previous role and he has made angel investments.The gaming industry is\u00a0only 40 years old, and it\u2019s very unique. On the one hand, it changes rapidly; it\u2019s at the forefront of technology, driving monetization and engagement. But it\u2019s also fickle. It\u2019s like a new dish. If you aren\u2019t familiar with a certain type of cuisine, it\u2019s hard to tell if one dish is better than another.\u00a0Not many are willing to invest in early-stage companies as a result. That means there aren\u2019t enough experienced thinkers and investors in this space to help the many real founders and tide them over. We\u2019re here to bridge that gap. TC: All over the world, correct? Am I right in thinking you are targeting 13 cities globally that you see as interactive entertainment hubs?JC: Yes.\u00a0If you want to have a strong impact in gaming, you have to do it globally. By nature, it\u2019s a global market, with hubs in Montreal and Vancouver and Seattle and the U.K, and the Nordic region and Seattle, L.A., Austin, and San Francisco.It\u2019s not as complicated as you might think. It\u2019s a very global community.TC: What size checks are you writing?JC: We\u2019re writing $1 million to $10 million checks, mostly at the Series A stage, though we\u2019ll dabble in seed if\u00a0we can find some good cases. We also lead when we invest, and we usually take a board seat.\u00a0TC: How many companies have you already backed with this new fund?JC: We\u2019ve made around 12 investments across the value chain, from content to interactive entertainment to back-end technologies to information data providers in the space. I believe we\u2019re picking the cream of the crop of the companies, too. We have a database that tracks the deals we\u2019re seeing and since May, we\u2019ve reviewed 600 pitches. I think that\u2019s probably 80 percent of what\u2019s in the space.TC: Are many of these VR related? Is that an area of interest, or an area to avoid?JC: We invest in VR but we won\u2019t do as much. There are enough dedicated VR funds out there that I don\u2019t think another adds much. I\u2019m a long-term believer, but from an investor perspective, i think the opportunity is around broader interactive entertainment.TC: Interactive entertainment, even more broadly, is very hits driven. Why isn\u2019t that a concern for you?JC:\u00a0If you really look, something new is happening every 12 to 24 months because the target segment is very young and attention spans are very short. You had Pok\u00e9mon Go. Now Fortnite is taking over in schools across the U.S.We\u2019re focused on what the next 18 to 24 months holds but also on the sustainable ways that we can help these companies grow over a four- or five-year range. For example, one of our theses centers on cloud-related development tools for game space. It\u2019s a big shift, with more complexity and calculations or computation required in cloud for the types of experiences that we\u2019ll see coming to mobile and PCs. One of our related investments is in Genvid, whose interactive streaming technology allows a viewer to actually touch the screen and impact the game state.\u00a0It sounds like sci-fi, but we\u2019re getting to a stage where spectators can participate, too.TC: You\u2019re hopping on a plane shortly leaving San Francisco. Where are you based?JC: On a Boeing 747. [Laughs.] I\u2019m based in Hong Kong, but I\u2019m maybe here a day or two a month. In April, I\u2019ll be in 16 different places across the U.S., Europe, and Asia.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/this-new-venture-fund-has-more-than-180-million-to-invest-in-interactive-gaming-startups/"},

{"title": ["AWS launches a cheaper single-zone version of its S3 storage service"], "text": "AWS\u2019 S3 storage service today launched a cheaper option for keeping data in the cloud \u2014 as long as developers are willing to give up a few 9s of availability in return for saving up to 20 percent compared to the standard S3 price for applications that need infrequent access. The name for this new S3 tier: S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access.S3 was among the first services AWS offered. Over the years, the company added a few additional tiers to the standard storage service. There\u2019s the S3 Standard tier with\u00a0the promise of 99.999999999 percent durability and 99.99 percent availability and S3 Standard-Infrequent Access with the same durability promise and 99.9 percent availability. There\u2019s also Glacier for cold storage.Data stored in the Standard and Standard-Infrequent access tiers is replicated across three or more availability zones. As the name implies, the main difference between those and the One Zone-Infrequent Access tier is that with this cheaper option, all the data sits in only one availability zone. It\u2019s still replicated across different machines, but if that zone goes down (or is destroyed), you can\u2019t access your data.Because of this, AWS only promises 99.5 percent availability and only offers a 99 percent SLA. In terms of features and durability, though, there\u2019s no difference between this tier and the other S3 tiers.As Amazon  CTO Werner Vogels noted in a keynote at the AWS Summit in San Francisco today, it\u2019s the replication across availability zones that defines the storage cost. In his view, this new service should be used for data that is infrequently accessed but can be replicated.An availability of 99.5 percent does mean that you should expect to experience a day or two per year where you can\u2019t access your data, though. For some applications, that\u2019s perfectly acceptable, and Vogels noted that he expects AWS customers to use this for secondary backup copies or for storing media files that can be replicated.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/aws-launches-a-cheaper-single-zone-version-of-its-s3-storage-service/"},
{"title": ["Facebook admits Cambridge Analytica hijacked data on up to 87M users"], "text": "Facebook  will warn 87 million users, mostly in the U.S, that their data \u201cmay have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica by apps that they or their friends used\u201d, the company just announced. Facebook CTO\u00a0Mike Schoepfer tells TechCrunch that Facebook will warn these users with a notice atop the News Feed with information about what data of theirs might have been attained, and what they should do now. It will also show its new bulk app permissions removal tool atop the feed.Schroepfer says that 87 million is the maximum number of users impacted, up from initial reports from the New York Times of 50 million people effected, as Facebook isn\u2019t positive of how many people had their data misused. It likely doesn\u2019t want to low-ball and have to revise the number upward later, as it did when it initially reported the Russian election interference ads were seen by 10 million users and later had to admit to congress it was actually 126 million when organic posts were included.\u00a0Mark Zuckerberg plans to take questions from reporters about the changes during a 1:00pm Pacific conference call on the subject.The changes come as part of a slew of announcements in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica  scandal including new restrictions on Facebook API use and the immediate shut down of the old Instagram API that was slated for July, but which started to break developers\u2019 apps this week. Facebook is now undergoing a deep audit of app developers that pulled a lot of data or that look suspicious, and Schroepfer promises Facebook will make further disclosures if it finds any situations similar to the Cambridge Analytica fiasco.Facebook is trying fix its broken data privacy after a developer named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan used the platform to administer a personality test app that collected data about participants and their friends. That data was then passed to Cambridge Analytica where it may have been leveraged to optimize political campaigns including that of 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump and the Brexit vote, allegations which the company itself vehemently denies. Regardless of how the data was employed to political ends, that lax data sharing was enough to ignite a firestorm around Facebook\u2019s privacy practices.Following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the company\u2019s stock dropped\u00a0precipitously, wiping more than $60 billion off its market capitalization from its prior period of stable growth. At the time of writing, Facebook was trading at $153.56.Facebook\u2019s core leadership was slow to respond to the explosion of negative attention, though Zuckerberg and Sandberg broke that silence with a flurry of media appearances, interviews and print ads. The company also came under the scrutiny of Congress once more and that pressure, which came from subcommittees in both the House and Senate and from both political parties, appears to have paid off. Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the\u00a0House Energy and Commerce Committee, just one of the several powerful committees calling for him, on April 11.While it\u2019s certainly unfortunate that it took mishandling user data on a large scale to do so, the incident has become the straw that broke the Facebook camel\u2019s back when it comes to privacy \u2014 and that appears to be catalyzing change. Schroepfer tells TechCrunch Facebook is now lifting every rock to find any other vulnerabilities that could be used to illicitly access or steal people\u2019s information.\u00a0Now we\u2019re getting changes that should have been in place years ago that could make Facebook a safer place to network for users concerned about how the company handles their private data.For more on Facebook\u2019s recent scandals and changes, read our other coverage:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/cambridge-analytica-87-million/"},
{"title": ["Facebook restricts APIs, axes old Instagram platform amidst scandals"], "text": "Facebook  is entering a tough transition period where it won\u2019t take chances around data privacy in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica fiasco, CTO Mike Schroepfer tells TechCrunch. That\u2019s why it\u2019s moving up the shut down of part of the Instagram API. It\u2019s\u00a0significantly limiting data available from or requiring approval for access to Facebook\u2019s Events, Groups, and Pages APIs plus Facebook Login. Facebook is also shutting down search by email or user name and changing its account recovery system after discovering malicious actors were using these to scrape people\u2019s data. \u201cGiven the scale and sophistication of the activity we\u2019ve seen, we believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped in this way\u201d Schroepfer writes.Instagram  will immediately shut down part of its old platform API that was scheduled for deprecation on July 31st. TechCrunch first reported that developers\u2019 Instagram apps were breaking over the weekend due to a sudden reduction in the API call limit. Instagram refused to comment, leading to developer frustration as their apps that analyze people\u2019s followers and help them grow their audiences stopped working.Now an Instagram spokesperson tells TechCrunch that\u00a0\u201cEffective today, Instagram is speeding up the\u00a0previously announced deprecation\u00a0of the Instagram API Platform\u201d as part of Facebook\u2019s work to protect people\u2019s data. The\u00a0APIs for follower lists, relationships, and commenting on public content will cease to function immediately. The December 11th, 2018 deprecation of public content reading APIs and the 2020 deprecation of basic profile info APIs will happen as scheduled, but it\u2019s implemented rate limit reductions on them now.The announcements come alongside Facebook\u2019s admission that up to 87 million users had their data improperly attained by Cambridge Analytica, up from early estimates of 50 million. These users will see a warning atop their News Feed about what happened, what they should do, and see surfaced options for removing other apps they gave permissions to. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to take questions about today\u2019s announcements during at 1:00pm Pacific conference call.Regarding the Facebook APIs, here\u2019s the abbreviated version of the changes and what they mean:Schroepfer says that Facebook\u2019s goal is to lock things down, review everything, and then figure out which developers deserve access and whether any of the functionality should be restored. The announcements raise questions about why it took the Cambridge Analytica  scandal for Facebook to take data privacy seriously. You can expect\u00a0the\u00a0House Energy and Commerce Committee may ask Mark Zuckerberg that when he comes to testify on April 10th.Facebook\u2019s bold action to reform its APIs shows it\u2019s willing to prioritize users above developers \u2014 at least once pushed by public backlash and internal strife. The platform whiplash could make developers apprehensive to build on Facebook in the future. But if Facebook didn\u2019t shore up data privacy, it\u2019d have no defense if future privacy abuses by outside developers came to light.Schroepfer tells me Facebook is taking its responsibility super seriously and that company is upset that it allowed this situation to happen. At least he seems earnest. Last week I wrote that Facebook needd to make a significant act of contrition and humility if it wanted stabilize the sinking morale of its employees. These sweeping changes qualify, and could serve as a rallying call for Facebook\u2019s team. Rather than sit with their heads in their hands, they have a roadmap of things to fix.Still, given the public\u2019s lack of understanding of APIs and platforms, it may be tough for Facebook to ever regain the trust broken by a month of savage headlines about the social network\u2019s privacy negligence. Long-term, this souring of opinion could make users hesitant to share as much on Facebook. But given its role as a ubiquitous utility for login with your identity across the web, our compulsive desire to scroll its feed and check its notifications, and the lack of viable social networking alternatives, Facebook might see the backlash blow over eventually. Hopefully that won\u2019t lead back to business as usual.For more on the recent Facebook platform changes, read our other stories:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/facebook-instagram-api-shut-down/"},

Until recently, IfOnly  was led by serial entrepreneur and founder Trevor Traina. But in January, Traina \u2014 a financial supporter of President Donald Trump \u2014 was nominated for an ambassadorship to Austria, and last Thursday, he was sworn in at his Pacific Heights home in San Francisco.With Traina off to Vienna, Boris will steer the company\u2019s growth, and its newest strategic partners should help.Both MasterCard  and Hyatt, for example, offer the kinds of experiences featured at IfOnly to help make their offerings a bit stickier for customers.Meanwhile, Sotheby\u2019s, known of its auctions business, has similarly been getting into the business of experiences. In December, anyone willing to pay enough could enjoy an after-hours tour of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy, before being treated to an authentic Venetian dinner. Another experience recently auctioned off by Sotheby\u2019s: the ability to host a private lunch or dinner for 10 at the iconic Philip Johnson Glass House in Connecticut.Both of these opportunities were expected to fetch in the tens of thousands of dollars \u2014 which is in the range of plenty of experiences featured on IfOnly. Among the costlier options available right now on its platform is a private concert with the band Third Eye Blind \u2014 which requires that interested parties \u201crequest a quote\u201d \u2014 and a one-of-a-kind crystal pet pendant by L.A. designer Irene Neuwirth, who, for $21,000, will also carve out enough time to say hello.IfOnly is also going after a much broader audience \u2014 one that may be looking for fresh experiences that won\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. It seems to be making some progress on that front, too.The company has now attracted two million registered users, and Boris says that roughly 25 percent of them engage regularly with the platform. Two years ago, when we spoke with Traina about the company\u2019s Series B round, IfOnly experiences were only available in San Francisco, L.A. and New York. Now, the platform features experiences in eight cities. It also seems to feature a greater breadth of experiences, and many more affordable options. (Among them: glass blowing in L.A.\u2019s Hermosa Beach, Calif., for $99 per person.)The company has plenty of competition, of course. Its most daunting rival may well be Airbnb, which is deriving a growing percentage of its revenue from travel services and bookable excursions with locals.Asked about this, Boris stresses that every experience on IfOnly is \u201cvetted,\u201d suggesting that Airbnb might not be controlling quality as tightly. He also says he welcomes the attention that Airbnb is paying to experiences. \u201cIt legitimizes that there\u2019s a multibillion-dollar market here,\u201d he says.IfOnly has now raised more than $40 million altogether.

The question is whether Zuckerberg\u2019s careful wording will let Facebook offer fewer privacy protections everywhere than GDPR mandates, or whether he truly means all of GDPR will be applied globally.[Update: 3pm Pacific: A Facebook spokesperson tells TechCrunch that Facebook does have plans to comply with GDPR\u2019s data privacy rules around the world, not just provide GDPR \u201ccontrols and settings\u201d as Zuckerberg mentioned. For example, Facebook offers the Download Your Information option globally to comply with data portability rules, updated its Data Use Policy today with details on collection practices to comply with the right to know how your data is being processed, and provides opt-outs to comply with consent rules.Facebook says that some laws elsewhere in the world conflict with GDPR\u2019s new laws for Europe so they can\u2019t be extended everywhere, and that the interface for some of these tools may vary. But overall it seems that Facebook is intent on bringing the same privacy and control afforded by GDPR to everyone.]GDPR goes into effect on May 25th, and places requirements on data controllers, forcing them to explain to people what personal data they intend to collect and why. It\u2019s focused around consent. Facebook has made its own moves to boost consent for ad targeting. TechCrunch reported that Facebook plans to implement a Custom Audiences Certification Tool that will require businesses to pledge that they had the consent to collect user email addresses and phone numbers that they\u2019re uploading to Facebook for ad targeting.GDPR also lets users request a copy of their personal information free-of-charge and get a response within a month. It gives people the right to not be subject to significant decisions by businesses that impact their privacy. Users also have some rights to erase their personal data if they withdraw consent or it\u2019s no longer necessary for the reason it was collected. Violations can trigger hefty fines.Zuckerberg\u2019s statements indicate that the progressive, privacy-first legislation passed in the European Union will benefit everyone. The inability to make unilateral changes to people\u2019s privacy and the right to erasure could hamper some of Facebook\u2019s ability to roll out new products and require it to build stronger systems to comply with user requests. But given how much Facebook earns from our data, making it jump through some hoops to give users more agency seems like a reasonable tradeoff.For more on GDPR, check out our explainer:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zuckerberg-gdpr/"},
{"title": ["App Store shrank for first time in 2017 thanks to crackdowns on spam, clones and more"], "text": "The App Store shrank for the first time in 2017, according to a new report from Appfigures. The report found the App Store lost 5 percent of its total apps over the course of the year, dropping from 2.2 million published iOS apps in the beginning of the year to 2.1 million by year-end.Google Play, meanwhile, grew in 2017 \u2014 it was up 30 percent to more than 3.6 million apps.Appfigures speculated the changes had to do with a combination of factors, including stricter enforcement of Apple\u2019s  review guidelines, along with a technical change requiring app developers to update their apps to the 64-bit architecture.Apple had also promised back in 2016 that it would clean up its iOS App Store by removing outdated, abandoned apps, including those that no longer met current guidelines or didn\u2019t function as intended. That cleanup may have well stretched into 2017, as app store intelligence firms only started seeing the effects\u00a0in late 2016. For example, there was a spike in app removals back in October 2016.Then in 2017, Apple went after clones and spam apps on the App Store. Combined with those apps that weren\u2019t 64-bit compatible and those that hadn\u2019t been downloaded in years, the removals reached into the hundreds of thousands over a 12-month period. Apple later went after template-based apps, too, before dialing back its policies over concerns it was impacting small businesses\u2019 ability to compete on the App Store.To see the App Store shrink, given these clear-outs, isn\u2019t necessarily surprising. However,\u00a0Appfigures found that removals of existing apps weren\u2019t the only cause. iOS developers weren\u2019t releasing as many apps as they had during the growth years, it also claims.Android developers launched 17 percent more apps in 2017 to reach 1.5 million total new releases. But iOS developers launched just 755,00 new apps \u2014 a 29 percent drop and the largest drop since 2008.But this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean developers weren\u2019t creating as many iOS apps \u2014 it could mean that Apple\u2019s review team has gotten tougher about how many apps it allows in. Thanks to the spam and clone app crackdown, fewer apps of questionable quality are being approved these days.In addition, some portion of the new Android app releases during the year were iOS apps being ported to the Google Play platform. More than twice as many apps came to Android in 2017 than Android apps coming to iOS, the report said.The full report also developed into the numbers of cross-platform apps (450,000 are on both stores), the most popular non-native tools (Cordova and Unity), the rise in native development, the countries shipping the most apps (U.S. followed by China) and the Play Store\u2019s growth.It can be viewed here.\u00a0", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/app-store-shrank-for-first-time-in-2017-thanks-to-crackdowns-on-spam-clones-and-more/"},

(You can find more specifics at this great list of Intel codenames on Wikipedia.)Variant 2 is the toughest of the chip flaws to block or work around, so the creation of fixes is nontrivial \u2014 Intel isn\u2019t just copying and pasting stuff into a microcode update for each of these.In the guidance document (PDF), Intel cited several reasons for stopping development on the fixes:In other words: it\u2019s super hard, they\u2019re barely supported and few people are using them where the bugs could be exploited.It\u2019s a reasonable walkback of the scope of Intel\u2019s mitigation efforts, especially when you look at the size of the list of platforms that are having the problems addressed.

Existing investors Madrona Ventures and Amplify Partners also joined this round, as well as new investors\u00a0Two Sigma Ventures and Workday Ventures.\u201cSuplari  uses advanced artificial intelligence on top of existing enterprise systems to proactively uncover the highest-value opportunities to pursue and empower the CFO or Chief Procurement Officer to unlock savings and profit that can be invested in growth, innovation, and their people,\u201d\u00a0said Suplari CEO and co-founder Nikesh Parekh in today\u2019s announcement.The company\u2019s cloud-based service allows businesses to analyze all of their procurement data across platforms and formats. This data can include contracts, purchasing data, product usage information and data from corporate credit card accounts.A number of Fortune 1000 customers have already signed up for the service and Supplari argues that it has helped its customers save software licensing fees by 33 percent and consolidate $200 million in professional service and temporary labor suppliers.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/suplari-raises-10-3-series-a-round-to-bring-ai-to-procurement/"},
{"title": ["Australia latest to open probe into Facebook data scandal"], "text": "Australia\u2019s privacy  watchdog has opened an investigation into Facebook in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal.Yesterday Facebook  revealed that more users than previously thought could have had their personal information passed to the company back in 2014 \u2014 saying as many as 87 million Facebook users\u00a0could have had their data \u201cimproperly shared\u201d, thereby confirming the testimony of ex-Cambridge Analytica employee, Chris Wylie, who last month told a UK parliamentary committee he believed that\u00a0substantially more than 50M Facebook users had had their information swiped.And while most of these Facebook users are located in the US, multiple millions are not.The company confirmed the international split yesterday in a blog post\u00a0\u2014 including that 1 million+ of the total are UK users; more than 620k are Canadian; and more than 300k are Australian.Though in tiny grey lettering at the bottom of the graphic Facebook caveats that these figures are merely its \u201cbest estimates\u201d of the maximum number of affected users.After the US, the largest proportion of Facebook users affected by the data leakage were in the Philippines and Indonesia.In a statement today the Australian watchdog (OAIC) said it has opened a formal investigation into Facebook.\u201cThe investigation will consider whether Facebook has breached the\u00a0Privacy Act 1988(Privacy Act). Given the global nature of this matter, the OAIC will confer with regulatory authorities internationally,\u201d it writes. \u201cAll organisations that are covered by the Privacy Act have obligations in relation to the personal information that they hold. This includes taking reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is held securely, and ensuring that customers are adequately notified about the collection and handling of their personal information.\u201dWe\u2019ve reached out to the National Privacy Commission in the Philippines for a reaction to the Cambridge Analytica  revelations.\u00a0Update:\u00a0The agency has now put out a statement\u00a0in which privacy commissioner Raymund Enriquez Liboroit states that Facebook told it 558 Filipino users had installed the personality quiz app that was used by CA as the route to harvest Facebook friend data \u2014 and ultimately to pull data on up to 1,175,312 more local users.\u201cMark Zuckerberg  claims he values the trust of his customers. This incident involving Cambride Analytica clearly puts this to question,\u201d the commissioner writes. \u201cWhile Facebook claims remediation is underway, we continue to call on Facebook to face us Filipinos with a new level of transparency. This should begin with their terms of service and settings that could be unclear to users. The process by which Facebook monitors third party app developers and tech providers who may have access to Filipino user data should also be looked into. This is to ensure that adequate protective nets are in place to guard against any abuse or misuse of data.\u201dHe goes on to call on Filipino Facebook users \u201cto be circumspect in using the platform and exercise online personal vigilance\u201d. \u201cUsers should minimize the personal information they share online and maximize the use of existing privacy protection features and tools,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe encourage the public to exercise a new level of care about their privacy and to take part in forming the future of Facebook in the country.\u201dIndonesia does not yet have a comprehensive regulation protecting personal data \u2014 and concerned consumers in the country can but hope this latest Facebook privacy scandal will act as a catalyst for change.Elsewhere, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada announced that it was opening a formal investigation into Facebook on March 26. In an\u00a0op-ed, privacy commissioner Daniel Therrien also wrote that the Cambridge Analytica scandal underscored deficiencies in the country\u2019s privacy laws.\u201cAt the moment, for example, federal political parties are not subject to privacy laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is clearly unacceptable. Information about our political views is highly sensitive and therefore particularly worthy of protection. We must take action in the face of serious allegations that democracy is being manipulated through analysis of the personal information of voters. Bringing parties under privacy laws would be a step in the right direction.\u201dBack in Europe, the UK\u2019s data watchdog, the ICO, was already investigating Facebook as part of a wider investigation into\u00a0data analytics for political purposes which it kicked off in May 2017.We\u2019ve asked if the agency intends to also open a second investigation into Facebook in light of the 1M+ UK users affected by the CA data mishandling \u2014 and will update this post with any response.\u00a0Update:\u00a0A spokesperson for the ICO said is investigating 30 organizations, including Facebook, as part of its probe into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, parties, social media companies and other commercial actors.\u201cThe ICO is looking at how data was collected from a third party app on Facebook and shared with Cambridge Analytica. We are also conducting a broader investigation into how social media platforms were used in political campaigning.The UK\u2019s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham,  added in a statement: \u201cFacebook has been co-operating with us and, while I am pleased with the changes they are making, it is too early to say whether they are sufficient under the law.\u201cThis is an important time for privacy rights. Transparency and accountability must be considered, otherwise it will be impossible to rebuild trust in the way that personal information is obtained, used and shared online. This is why, besides my investigation, which could result in enforcement action, I will also be making clear public policy recommendations to help us understand how our personal data is used online and what we can do to control how it\u2019s used.\u201dLate last month Denham revealed the watchdog had been looking into Facebook\u2019s partner category service as part of its political probe, examining how the company used third party data to inform targeted advertising.In a statement\u00a0then she said she had raised the service as \u201ca significant area of concern\u201d with Facebook \u2014 and welcomed Facebook\u2019s decision to shutter it.And last month\u00a0the ICO was also granted a warrant to enter and search Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices.Reacting to the Cambridge Analytica scandal last month, Andrea Jelinek, chair of the European Union\u2019s  influential data protection body, the Article 29 Working Party \u2014 which is made up of reps of all the national DPAs \u2014 said the group would be supporting the ICO\u2019s investigation.\u201cAs a rule personal data cannot be used without full transparency on how it is used and with whom it is shared. This is therefore a very serious allegation with far-reaching consequences for data protection rights of individuals and the democratic process,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cICO, the UK \u0301s data protection authority, is conducting the investigation into this matter. As Chair of the Article 29 Working Party, I fully support their investigation. The Members of the Article 29 Working Party will work together in this process.\u201dAlso last month the European Commission\u2019s justice and consumer affairs commissioner, Vera Jourova, told the BBC that the executive body would like to see new legislation in the US to strengthen data protection.In Europe the incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) beefs up the enforcement of privacy rules with tighter requirements on how data is handled and a new regime of tougher fines for violations.\u201cWe would like to see more robust and reliable legislation on American side,\u201d said Jourova. \u201cSomething similar or comparable with the GDPR. And I believe that one day it will happen also in United States and that\u2019s why I am now so curious how American society will react on this scandal \u2014 and other scandals which might come.\u201dThe EC has\u00a0a specific lever to press the US on this point \u2014 in the form of the Privacy Shield arrangement which simplifies the process of authorizing personal data flows between the EU and the US by allowing companies to self-certify their adherence to a set of privacy principles.Both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica are signatories to Privacy Shield \u2014 and are currently listed as \u2018active participants\u2019 in the framework (for now).\u00a0A spokesman for Jourova confirmed that listed companies can be removed by the FTC \u2014 although he also noted that the Cambridge Analytica data misuse pre-dates Privacy Shield  (which was signed in August 2016).\u201cThe FTC has made use of this possibility already a number of times under the Privacy Shield,\u201d he added of the possibility of listed companies being removed from the framework.The Privacy Shield mechanism was negotiated as a direct replacement for Safe Harbor after Europe\u2019s top court struck down that earlier arrangement, in 2015, in the wake of the Snowden disclosures about US government mass surveillance programs.The Privacy Shield arrangement has its critics. It also includes a regime of annual reviews. In the BBC interview Jourova made a point of reminding the US that the arrangement \u2014 which thousands of companies rely on to keep their data flows moving \u2014 remains under constant review.She also said she would be writing to Facebook seeking answers about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\u00a0\u201cWhat we want from Facebook is to obey and to respect the European laws,\u201d she added.For its part Facebook caused confusion about its commitment to raising data protection standards on its platform this week after founder Mark Zuckerberg told a Reuters journalist that it will not be universally applying GDPR for all its users \u2014 given the law applies for all Facebook\u2019s international users that essentially means the company intends to apply a lower privacy standard for North American users (whose data is processed in the US, rather than in Ireland where its international HQ is located, within the EU).However in a follow up conference call with journalists Zuckerberg made some carefully worded remarks that seem to further fog the issue \u2014 saying: \u201cWe intend to make all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe\u201d yet going on to caveat that statement with:\u00a0\u201cIs it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We\u2019ll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places.\u201dAt this stage it remains unclear whether Facebook will universally apply GDPR or not. Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks suggest there will indeed be some discrepancies in how it handles data protection for different users \u2014 what those differences will be remains to be seen.In remarks made on Twitter today, Jourova described the growing scale of the data misuse scandal as \u201cvery worrying\u201d \u2014 and said the Commission\u00a0\u201cwill watch closely\u201d how the company\u2019s application of GDPR \u201cwill work in practice\u201d.The UK\u2019s digital minister, Matt Hancock, has also tweeted about the data misuse scandal \u2014 saying he will be meeting Facebook representatives next week and expects the company \u201cto explain why they put the data of over a million of our citizens at risk\u201d. \u201cThis is completely unacceptable, and they must demonstrate this won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Hancock added.Yesterday the Facebook founder also revealed that search tools on the platform had made it possible for \u201cmalicious actors\u201d to discover the identities and collect information on most of its 2 billion users worldwide \u2014 essentially confessing to yet another massive data leak.He said Facebook had now disabled the tool.As with the millions of Facebook users whose data was improperly passed to Cambridge Analytica, the company is unlikely to be able to precisely confirm the full extent of how the search loophole was exploited to leak personal data.Nor will it be able to delete any of the personal information that was maliciously swiped.This report was updated with additional comment", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/australia-latest-to-open-probe-into-facebook-data-scandal/"},
{"title": ["Southeast Asia fashion startup Zilingo continues its meteoric rise with $54M Series C"], "text": "Many will rightly say that raising money as a startup in Southeast Asia is no easy thing, but up-and-coming online fashion service Zilingo  sure doesn\u2019t seem to have problems on that front.Fresh from raising an $18 million Series B round last September, Zilingo has announced its $54 million Series C to take it to $82 million from investors to date.The round was led by new investor Sofina \u2014 an investor in Flipkart-owned fashion site Myntra among others \u2014 and existing backers Burda  and Sequoia India. Zilingo\u2019s\u00a0other existing investors, including\u00a0Tim Draper, SIG, Venturra, Beenext and Manik Arora, all took part, with Amadeus Capital joining the party, too.Raising this much money is rare over the life cycle of any startup in Southeast Asia, but to do it in less than 2.5 years after launching your product is unprecedented.E-commerce is a hot space in the region, but few companies have made the jump to Series B and beyond with success; in order to make the leap, Singapore-headquartered Zilingo has gone about things\u00a0in a different way from others in its immediate space.The company started in Thailand in 2015, when it was founded by Ankiti Bose  (CEO) and\u00a0Dhruv Kapoor (CTO). Bose, a former analyst with Sequoia India and McKinsey, had the idea of bringing traditional sellers\u00a0online after visiting Bangkok and marveling at the rich variety of fashion items being sold\u00a0at street markets.Now, however, the company has risen above online sales to a position as a platform that caters to merchants, retailers and brands for both B2C and B2B sales. That\u2019s been enabled by an early focus on providing basic services for retailers beyond just an online storefront.We noted when we first wrote about Zilingo\u00a0that the company offered a seller management tool which handled processes like inventory management, stock and sales for small retailers who might not already be digital. Aside from boosting touch points with merchants, its key target, these services have evolved over time and become both an additional revenue generator and an important defensive moat for Zilingo\u2019s business, while, not to mention, providing insight and direction for product development.Zilingo\u2019s e-commerce site sells directly to consumers in\u00a0Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, and it ships internationally to four more countries. Its tech team is in India while it has supply bases in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia, but it has pushed on. With financial services from third parties, a \u201cstyle hunter\u201d that aggregates upcoming trends from fashion watchers and icons, product sourcing and content and photography services, the targets have expanded to include\u00a0professional fashion sellers, SMEs, brands and B2B buyers located outside of Southeast Asia.The idea is no longer just about bringing the long tail of market sellers online, but instead to enable increased efficiencies for all. That means organization services, financial products and sales for the long-tail merchants, but trend analysis, B2B sales/sourcing and more advanced options to the more sophisticated end of brands and larger retailers.\u201cWe realized that the long tail is a good way to start, but if you want to build the biggest player in this space, then you have to have all the supply,\u201d Bose told TechCrunch. \u201cThe reason they\u2019d stay with us is because they have a dependence with us.\u201dBose said that Zilingo doesn\u2019t pressure its merchants to use Zilingo.com for consumers sales \u2014 although it is obviously preferential \u2014 which means it has a potential that allows it to start working with those who are on rival services, which chiefly includes Rocket Internet\u2019s well-funded Zalora business.So a brand using Zalora for sales, for example, might source its products or materials from sellers on Zilingo. Further down the line, Zilingo could use that relationship to persuade it to open a Zilingo.com store.That has seen revenue skyrocket. While Bose isn\u2019t revealing exact sales figures, she said that revenue has grown \u201cover 10X\u201d in the last 12, months with more than 10,000 sellers and two million products now on the Zilingo.com platform.That jump is primarily thanks to a move into Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy, the emergence of\u00a0B2B sales \u2014 i.e. labels or merchants using Zilingo to buy fashion items to then sell to consumers \u2014 and some of the optional, paid-for services such as loans or credit. Now, Bose said, the once-core B2C business from Zilingo.com accounts for just 40 percent of the revenue.That platform strategy goes some way to explaining why investors are doubling down on the business despite a \u201cbloodbath\u201d \u2014 as Bose puts it \u2014 in the B2C fashion commerce space in Southeast Asia.Zalora is the big player, while others include JD.com-backed Pomelo and Singapore\u2019s Love Bonito, both of which have raised low double-digit USD rounds to move into brick and mortar retail. Zilingo, meanwhile, has transcended the sales race by building a product that can live without a dependency on its Zilingo.com e-commerce service.The company is putting that to the test this week with the launch of a B2B service for U.S. and Europe-based fashion sellers and labels.ZilingoAsiaMall.com\u00a0is a\u00a0destination where smaller retailers and other B2B buyers can source fashion items from Southeast Asia-based resellers for similar prices to that which top global fashion names enjoy, but without the commitment of massive order volumes.\u201cMajor global fashion brands source most apparel from Asia at $1.5/piece for massive quantities of over a million pieces,\u201d a Zilingo representative explained. \u201cWe saw how Zilingo could leverage its existing Asian supply chain network built from its consumer business to drive value for the American and European fashion businesses. ZAM has figured out how retailers can source quality, current products at $2/piece for quantities as low as 200 and also make it an easy experience.\u201d\u201cSome 49 percent of all exports globally in fashion come from ASEAN, China and Bangladesh [so]\u00a0we are basically sitting at the source,\u201d Bose told TechCrunch.\u201cMerchants want to buy from our B2B platforms and sell on B2C channels, Zilingo could be one of them,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a high-margin profitable business and we want to scale that up.\u201dZilingo said it still has its Series B round in the bank, so that, combined with this newest funding, gives it quite the war chest for investment.Aside from pushing its international strategy, the company plans to add more tech services to its merchant ecosystem while also expanding its Zilingo.com e-commerce site deeper into Southeast Asia. The Philippines is top of the list, but opening up in Vietnam and Malaysia is also on the planner.The company will also continue to build its brand and market share in its existing Southeast Asian markets. There\u2019s a particular focus on Indonesia where it recently signed actress\u00a0Pevita Pearce to front its first TV ad campaign.As for raising more money right after the Series B, Bose said that the timing felt right.\u201cThe logic behind raising this round is that Southeast Asia is heating up but fashion doesn\u2019t have a big leader because Zalora is stumbling, but it is also the only high-margin vertical in e-commerce,\u201d she said.\u201cWhen things are going well, there\u2019s momentum, and we figured that we might as well use that because this is a fantastic time to be running a startup in Southeast Asia \u2014 people are taking the region seriously,\u201d she added, referencing increased investments from Tencent and Alibaba.Unbelievably, Zilingo closed the Series C round \u201cweeks\u201d after its Series B, according to Sequoia India  managing director Shailendra Singh. Bose explained that investors had begun to see the results of the B2B push and were keen to double down right there and then.Luckily for the rest of the market, there are no imminent Series D plans at this point\u2026 apparently.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zilingo-raises-54-million/"},

It\u2019s clear that investors are taken with the San Jose-based automation company. By most accounts, increasingly automated warehouses are undergoing a staffing crunch, and Fetch offers the promise of humans and robots working peacefully in tandem. Today the company announced a pair of new robots designed remove some of the pain points from warehouse fulfillment. Both are modules that plug onto the top of the company\u2019s VirtualConveyor robot \u2014 a kind of large, warehouse Roomba designed two autonomously navigate from point A to point B in a space, while avoiding collisions with people, aisles and dropped objects, in the process.RollerTop is, as you may have already guessed by the extremely straight-forward name, adds a series of rollers to the top of the robot. The rollers themselves are powered, so the robot can drive up to a conveyor belt, line itself up and send a box along for pickup. The other big addition here is CartConnect, a module with a pair of metal spikes capable of picking up and transporting carts around the warehouse. TechCrunch spent some time with CEO Melonee Wise earlier this week at the company\u2019s recently opened San Jose headquarters. The exec told us that the modules represent a big piece of Fetch\u2019s model, moving forward. The company likely won\u2019t iterate too much on the actual robotic hardware base in the near term, instead focusing on these key accessories, along with software updates.The pieces do, however, point to a way forward for the system, which will be capable of a broad range of different tasks with the right add-ons in place. As companies like Amazon have completely shifted the expectation for warehouse logistics, many companies find themselves rushing the keep up. It\u2019s clear, for example, why DHL has already made a point of deploying some of Fetch\u2019s machines.

In addition, the service also allows you to optimize your models by tweaking the hyperparameters of your experiments. As you train your model, Comet tracks the results and provides you with a graph of your results, but it also tracks your code changes and imports them so that you can later compare all the different aspects of the various versions of your experiments.Developers can easily integrate Comet into their machine learning frameworks, no matter whether they use the Keras API, TensorFlow, Scikit Learn, Pytorch or simply like to write Java code. To get started, developers simply add the Comet.ml tracking code to their apps and run their experiments as usual. The service is completely agnostic as to where you train your models and\u00a0 you can obviously share access to\u00a0 your results with the rest of your team.Ideally, this means that data scientist can stick with their existing workflow and development tools, but in addition to those, they now have a new tool that gives them better insights into how well their experiments are working.\u201cWe realized that ML teams look a lot like software teams looked ten or fifteen years ago,\u201d Comet.ml co-founder and CEO Gideon Mendels told me.

So far, these users have developers about 6,000 models on the platform.Looking ahead, the Comet.ml team plans to give developers more tools to build better and more accurate models, though as Mendels noted, to do that, the company had to get this first building block in place.Comet.ml is now available to all developers who want to give it a try.

{"title": ["Pinterest aims for products from the store down your street as its next big ad business"], "text": "Pinterest  is known for having, and promoting, a lot of business content. It\u2019s actually a majority of the content, and it\u2019s usually from some of the most well-known brands that feed into the kinds of sometimes dream-level wants and needs of its users.And while a majority of Pinterest\u2019s potential is locked up there, the company has increasingly turned its gaze toward smaller and smaller businesses to try to entice users with local content \u2014 including that clothing store right down your street. That\u2019s part of the reasoning behind Pinterest\u2019s Propel program, which it started a year ago to work with small businesses that really either didn\u2019t know what they were doing, or had just never done it before.\u00a0In another step toward that goal, Pinterest has hired Matt Hogle to be the global head of small business.Hogle spent 9 years at Facebook, working with small businesses and will be part of the effort for the company to try to find the right set of tools and strategies in place to appeal to small businesses as it starts to ramp it into a significant portion of its revenue. The number of small businesses advertisers on Pinterest has increased by around 50% year-over-year, the company said, and it looks to continue to refine a kind of hybrid strategy that mixes platforms and interactions with real people in order to entice those businesses. That\u2019s important for, say, a local clothing store that only has one store and a limited online shop, but has products that would perform well on their own as content on Pinterest \u2014 and could quickly add revenue if they started advertising on it.\u201cWe, as an ads business, know what customers\u2019 business objectives are, and we capture that at the early stages,\u201d Pinterest head of global sales Jon Kaplan said. \u201cWe know what they\u2019re targeting, how they\u2019re targeting, who, and we know the creative best practices. We should be able in the very near future to take all these elements and say, oh this is your objective, we\u2019ll obfuscate all this complexity and hit a target [return on ad spend] you have. We\u2019re not far. We\u2019ve obfuscated a lot of the levers one can pull in Propel.\u201dPropel, for now, is adopting an increasingly popular human/digital approach for smaller businesses that are looking to advertise for the first time on Pinterest. If they have no experience whatsoever, or don\u2019t even know what to do, Pinterest\u2019s goal is to serve as a resource for best practices when it comes to creative content down to where to target it. Pinterest is increasingly rolling out more self-serve tools with more robust targeting and tracking, but the kind of small businesses \u2014 the sum of which could eventually account for a big chunk of its revenue \u2014 that Facebook has snapped up with the prospect of getting in front of the exact right people at the right time. The company says it will be rolling out the \u201cpromote\u201d button, which allows advertisers to click a button on a pin to quickly spin up a campaign, to Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK in the next coming weeks.In the end, Pinterest still has 200 million monthly active users, which is absolutely dwarfed by Facebook\u2019s billions of users. But at the same time, Pinterest may be able to capitalize on the good will that Facebook has torched in light of its massive privacy scandal in which information on as many as 87 million users ended up in the hands of a research firm without authorization or permission. Facebook can prove a return on spend, but it can\u2019t at the moment prove that it\u2019ll be able to keep doing the same things that get that return on spend now that the Internet is revolting against Facebook for its massive breach of trust. (Hogle, to be clear, joined before details on the Cambridge Analytica scandal began pouring in.)Pinterest\u2019s value to advertisers is that it\u2019s able to capture a potential customer when they are just a user clicking (or tapping) around Pinterest looking for ideas. Whether planning life events or just looking for wardrobe suggestions, Pinterest is able to go to advertisers and say they can catch them in those discovery stages and then stick the right ad in front of them to get their attention. Then, the service can follow the user all the way from when they are actually interested in doing something, searching for what to do, and eventually saving that product \u2014 or buying it.It\u2019s that potential value for advertisers that\u2019s taken it to a $12.5 billion valuation in its most recent financing round. But while Pinterest is probably still a sort of curiosity buy for larger advertisers and brands, the challenge has been to chase down the businesses that don\u2019t have huge marketing budgets and might not even be considering Pinterest as a potential advertising platform. After all, the playbook for Facebook is robust and there are plenty of success stories, and the same is true for Google. But at the same time, that bespoke coffee shop down on Valencia Street in San Francisco may have products that line up perfectly for a Pinterest user that\u2019s looking for a holiday gift down the line.\u201cOver the coming nine months, into 2019, I think we\u2019re gonna continue to invest in ways that make it easy for our small businesses to grow with us,\u201d Hogle said. \u201cSmall businesses are unique in the sense that they don\u2019t have the time or energy or resources \u2014 the CEO might also be the HR person and the marketing person, and so on. We need to make it extremely lightweight and seamless. At the end of the day, if we can\u2019t provide value and deliver on the money they spend with us and demonstrate the value that\u2019s created there \u2014 sales being that number one performance indicator for these companies \u2014 then we\u2019re failing. The things we\u2019re gonna continue to build are ways to make that process as easy and seamless.\u201d\u201cSmall businesses add disproportionate value to Pinners and our ad ecosystem,\u201d Hogle said. \u201cI truly believe that small businesses are part of the fabric of every community, they\u2019re the engine that drives every economy around the world. Their relevancy, category or vertical, or proximity to consumers creates disproportionate organic value to Pinners and also creates disproportionate commercial value. Our goal is to show the people the most relevant ad they possibly can based on what they\u2019re trying to accomplish. We can\u2019t do that if we do not meet the needs of the vast majority of businesses that exist. It is a strategic decision, but it\u2019s not just one that goes into paid ads, it creates disproportionate value for the entire platform and ecosystem.\u201dHogle\u2019s conversations started mid last year with Tim Kendall, Pinterest\u2019s former president who left in November last year. What started as an exchange of ideas turned, as these conversations often do, it discussions about a potential job at Pinterest, and finally months later he ended up joining to start helping with the company\u2019s small business efforts. Pinterest is increasingly looking to staff up with a suite of executives that will help it get its business in order ahead of a potential IPO. That includes a new COO, Francoise Brougher, who joined in February from Square.But if Pinterest is going to eventually go public, and get its employees and investors paid out for their efforts, it needs to show that it can be a business that\u2019s beyond just a curiosity budget for a big brand. Getting small businesses on board, like the ones Hogle looks to capture that are right down the street, are a big part of what the company hopes will eventually show that it has a diversified revenue stream and not beholden to just the big and potentially fickle budgets of larger brands.\u201cOur ad platform is not very old by industry standards, but the rate of development on our self serve tools and the rate of development on interfaces for our small customers is moving at a pace where I\u2019m really pleased,\u201d Hogle said. \u201cThe ability to carve out opportunity for advertisers is something that\u2019s moving really quickly. Is it where it needs to be long term, of course not, but we\u2019re gonna continue to invest. One of the reasons I joined was it was very clear to me that small businesses were a priority. We are going to invest in products and we\u2019re also going to invest in educational programs. We\u2019re gonna invest and provide the necessary resources.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/pinterest-aims-for-products-from-the-store-down-your-street-as-its-next-big-ad-business/"},

Last week Adobe trotted out the customer experience system of record at Adobe Summit. Meanwhile, Salesforce announced its Integration Cloud. Today Kahuna, a Redwood City, California startup, announced a platform to compete with the giants to help brands build more targeted interactions.CEO Sameer Patel says the company is a cloud service designed to give users more information with artificial intelligence underpinnings. The goal is to help them push the customer toward the sale finish line by reducing the online noise around a sale and keeping the conversation going when the customer goes quiet.\u201cIf you are a seller we reduce cognitive overload for buyers by suggesting a few but better targeted products. Using AI, we optimize your message copy and subject lines. We can reduce shopping cart abandonment with better offers. We trigger real-time action to close transactions, facilitating paid placement and promotions,\u201d Patel told TechCrunch.This involves understanding the customer better and feeding the artificial intelligence engine, and that involves data, of course. Patel says the company spent a year just building a real-time data platform when it was formed in 2011.\u201cKahuna  can ingest data from live interactions via [our] SDK or third-party systems like order management. We can capture any new gestures from [these sources] and update the user\u2019s profile in four seconds or less. Once that\u2019s done, we apply AI to determine the best message, best time, best subject line, best device and best channel,\u201d he explained.Whenever there is this level of customer data collection, there are questions about data privacy, especially with EU GDPR data protection rules on the horizon. \u201cEven before GDPR, we always co-opted the user rights from the customer (the marketplace) and no more. iI you didn\u2019t give the marketplace permission, then we don\u2019t have permission. Period,\u201d Patel stated.A platform like this is only as good as the data integration points, and the company also announced a couple of big partnerships. \u201cFor this announcement, we are coming out the gate with Oracle/Responsys integration (their email marketing works with the Kahuna platform) and Magento (Kahuna will incorporate user signals from the commerce engine to make our user profile and AI work smarter).\u201d He says the platform has been designed to plug in other services, and he expects that there will be additional partnerships over time.Kahuna launched in 2011 and has raised $58 million in venture investment.

If users need more people in the chat (which, for those of us who have large conference calls, sounds awful!), Snap  is also offering group voice calls with up to 32 participants.The feature is relatively simple. Just tap the video icon in a group chat to get started, or start up a call with a few people and invite new friends to join.As one might expect, Snapchat\u2019s crown jewel filters will also be available to use within a group video chat.Folks that aren\u2019t camera ready can easily toggle between voice and video to just voice.Snap first introduced group chat and video chat in 2016, looking to give people new ways to communicate on the image-first platform. Snap says that the community is making millions of calls a day since launch.That said, it\u2019s worth wondering about the timing of this new feature, which comes almost two years after the company announced video chat. It\u2019s possible that Snap wants to take advantage of the #deletefacebook movement offering people as much functionality as possible to connect on their platform instead of the incumbent\u2019s.It\u2019s also worth noting that Snap\u2019s 16-person group video chat is strikingly similar to Houseparty, the video chat app launched by the founders of live streaming app Meerkat.Alongside the introduction of group video calls, Snap is also bringing @mentions to the platform.

This Thursday, Twitter will live stream the Texas Rangers versus the Oakland Athletics at 3:35 PM ET. The game will be the first of the weekly day-game live streams of out-of-market MLB games in the weeks ahead, during the 2018 season.The MLB will announce the games that will air on Twitter ahead of each month\u2019s slate, usually via a tweet.Twitter has worked with the MLB before. As the company was ramping up its live streaming efforts in 2016, it announced it would begin\u00a0streaming weekly MLB games, along with those from other sports organizations like the NHL and NFL. It then aired weekly games from April through October 2017.Now it will be a home to weekly games, available to U.S. users to stream for free from April through September 2018.Fans can watch the games on live.twitter.com/MLB online and on connected devices, and they don\u2019t need to login to a Twitter account in order to do so. However, the games will not be exclusive to Twitter. The company notes that each stream is a simulcast with a participating team\u2019s local TV broadcast, and that Twitter will be offering advertising packages for the content to be made available to sponsors.There is a rev share on those ad deals, but Twitter declined to comment on how the revenue is split.Twitter is not the only online home to MLB games. Facebook recently scored an exclusive deal to live stream 25 afternoon games \u2013 which means they won\u2019t be available elsewhere.The MLB has been busy making its games available on newer streaming services, too. For example, YouTube TV announced last month a multi-year deal to be the presenting sponsor for the World Series, which includes plans to heavily market its service with in-stadium signage, TV ads, on-air callouts, and more. And ESPN+, the Disney-owned streaming service arriving this month, will air over 180 MLB games, with the option to view more by purchasing the MLB.TV out-of-market package.In addition to the games, the MLB will again be making real-time highlights available via its @MLB Twitter account throughout the season, with Spanish highlights available from @LasMayores during 2018, says Twitter.\u00a0 And Twitter has partnered with the MLB on hashtag-triggered emoji for all 30 MLB teams.The April schedule of games is available below:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/twitter-to-live-stream-weekly-mlb-games-in-renewed-deal/"},
{"title": ["South Korean capital Seoul mulls \u2018S-Coin\u2019 tokens and blockchain-based government"], "text": "South Korea has been at the forefront of the blockchain movement, with some of the highest density of cryptocurrency traders anywhere in the world. Now, as the frenzy around cryptocurrency prices recedes (Bitcoin is around $7350 right now, down from a high of almost $20,000 last December), the country is starting to consider the more utilitarian aspects of blockchain that might not immediately lead to riches.Seoul\u2019s mayor, Park Won-soon, discussed the city\u2019s plans to launch what is currently being dubbed the S-coin in an interview with CoinDesk. In his vision of the program, the coin could be used for subway fares, as well as \u201ca payment method for city-funded welfare programs for public employees, young job seekers and citizens helping the environment by saving electricity, water and gas.\u201dThat\u2019s a remarkable statement coming from an office that is widely considered to be the second most important in the country. It\u2019s also a far cry from the strong opposition that national leaders and regulators voiced toward blockchain \u2014 and cryptocurrencies in particular \u2014 during the run up in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices last year, particularly in the wake of a series of Bitcoin heists by North Korea.Back then, the Korean financial authorities and the Justice Ministry said that they were considering outright banning cryptocurrencies. Now, over the past few weeks, national authorities have quietly floated new proposals around Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), potentially creating a procedure that would allow ICOs in well-regulated circumstances. Mayor Park also said in his interview with CoinDesk that further regulation would be necessary around blockchains before any of Seoul\u2019s proposals could be brought into effect.The invention of blockchain, and Bitcoin in particular, was seen by many in the community as a way to \u201cdisrupt\u201d politics as usual, by moving power away from central authorities to decentralized players. However, the technology increasingly looks like it will be subsumed by the state to improve existing institutions.South Korean cities, like counterparts elsewhere around the world, are investigating whether blockchain technology could provide mechanisms like algorithmic zoning. City governments often hold many records of interest to blockchain specialists, including property records, ID records, zoning codes, business and health licenses, as well as construction permits. Creating a transparent and efficient clearinghouse for such information could generate significant gains for the quality of urban governance.In this context, it is important to clearly delineate blockchain as database and cryptocurrencies as money. The proposals from Seoul and elsewhere have been designed around the former. Even when such tokens might provide a financial benefit, such as a discount on subway fares or housing, these tokens are not designed to be fungible currencies in the same way that cryptocurrencies are, but instead convenience tools to provide digital access to amenities.That\u2019s in contrast to initiatives like the one from Venezuela to create an oil-backed cryptocurrency called Petro, which many analysts saw as a convenient means to avoid U.S.-led sanctions on the Maduro regime. The Trump administration blocked the purchase of Petro last month.Seoul is expected to announce a roadmap for blockchain in the coming weeks, and other cities are coming close to launching their own initiatives. The value bubble in cryptocurrencies may be receding, but their practical uses may well drive the next wave of innovation.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/s-coin/"},
{"title": ["Shorter, skippable ads will be coming to YouTube"], "text": "YouTube  today is introducing a new way for advertisers to maximize reach from their shorter ads. The change arrives around two years after YouTube\u2019s introduction of the six-second bumper, which the company says advertisers have learned how to best use to raise brand awareness, despite having only a few seconds to tell their story. Now, advertisers will have the benefit of building bumper-like or longer ads to gain broader reach, while still allowing the ads to be skipped after 5 seconds like all TrueView ads.With the existing TrueView in-stream ads, which air before or during a video, advertisers only pay when the viewer watches at least 30 seconds or to the end of the video, or they take action by clicking on a card or other elements of the creative to learn more.TrueView for Reach is meant to combine the best of two worlds \u2013 short-form bumper ads, and the user choice offered through the TrueView in-stream format.The company says the addition will expand advertisers\u2019 options with TrueView ads. Depending on campaign objectives, advertisers can opt for\u00a0TrueView for Views (standard) ads, TrueView for Action, or TrueView for Reach \u2013 all of which are skippable after 5 seconds.\u201cTrueView for reach brings our popular in-stream format built on user choice together with the simplicity of CPM buying,\u201d says YouTube, in an announcement. \u201cOptimized for efficient reach, this format can help you to raise awareness among a broad set of customers \u2014 and do so within our 95% viewable and 95% audible environment.\u201dThe company says that during beta testing the format across 84 campaigns, 9 out of 10 drove a significant lift in ad recall, with average lift of nearly 20 percent.Samsung Electronics America said it was able to reach 50+ percent more people at half the CPM with TrueView for Reach, when it tested the format, while Pepsi France said that format helped deliver high reach, but also high completion rates for its 10-second video.\u201cMoreover, CPMs proved to be more competitive: we saw 30% lower CPMs on average compared to previous campaigns. This ultimately drove lower average costs on incremental reach points: -46% versus TV on specific target audiences,\u201d explained\u00a0Vanessa Tsangaratos, Digital Marketing Manager at Pepsi France.The expansion of ad format options for YouTube is becoming even more critical to brands and advertisers, given the continued rise in cord cutting and adoption of subscription video on demand services, like Netflix, which are ad-free.As YouTube notes in a blog post, advertising was simpler in the TV era \u2013 you\u2019d just find the most popular shows, and place your brand there in the commercial breaks. Now advertisers are trying to find a place to gain attention for their brand in a far more complex landscape \u2013 there are video ads not only on streaming services like Hulu, but also on live TV services, on YouTube and even on social media, like Facebook and Instagram.The goal is to now find a place to advertise where you can actually capture users\u2019 attention.YouTube claims it\u2019s that place, of course. It cites a recent Ipsos study that found people are 3 times more likely to pay attention to online video ads compared with TV ads.TrueView for reach is not the only TrueView option for YouTube advertisers. The newer TrueView for action is also available for those advertisers who want to customize a call-to-action that\u2019s important to their business, like leads or referrals.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/youtube-launches-a-shorter-skippable-ad-format/"},
{"title": ["COSMIQ maker Deepblu launches a booking platform it calls the \u201cAirbnb of diving\u201d"], "text": "After it took James Tsuei a month of research and emails to plan a dive in Indonesia, he decided it was time for his startup, Deepblu, to launch a booking platform for divers. Planet Deepblu bills itself as \u201cthe Airbnb for diving\u201d and is the latest piece of the diving ecosystem the Taipei-based startup is building.Based in Taipei and backed by Silverlink Capital, Deepblu  was founded in 2015 to bring resources for divers into the mobile, cloud-based era. Its products included a Bluetooth-enabled dive computer called COSMIQ and a social network where users share dive logs. Dive computers are small devices, often worn like wristwatches, that let divers track and calculate important information, such as when they need to take a decompression stop. COSMIQ automates a lot of the process and enables divers to wirelessly sync dive logs to Deepblu\u2019s social network, which the startup claims now has more than 40,000 members, 500 dive shops and 300,000 dive logs.Deepblu drew on its community for Planet Deepblu, integrating their dive logs, reviews, videos and photos to help users plan diving trips. There are already several dive booking sites out there, but Tsuei, Deepblu\u2019s co-founder and chief executive officer, says they operate more like Agoda or Booking.com, while Planet Deepblu\u2019s Airbnb-like approach means divers can use it to communicate directly with dive operators instead of relying on agencies.Tsuei claims this can save them up to 25% on the total cost of a trip. By serving as a centralized database for dive planning, Planet Deepblu also wants to save its users time.Part of Deepblu\u2019s mission is to give scuba diving the same visibility and cultural prominence as golfing by making it more accessible to beginners as well as advanced divers. Though it\u2019s a niche market, diving has a lot of financial potential. Tsuei says there are currently about 6 to 8 million active divers, or people who make three or more diving sessions each year, and dive trips are big investments. Divers spend an average of $1,000 on equipment and certification, and then even more money on dive shops (businesses run by expert divers who provide training and tours), flights and accommodation. For passionate divers, it\u2019s more than just a hobby.\u201cIt\u2019s like golfing,\u201d says Tsuei. \u201cThere\u2019s a higher barrier to entry because it takes time and money, but it also becomes part of your lifestyle.\u201d Out of the 40,000 members of Deepblu\u2019s social network, the company says about 40% have uploaded their own dive logs, which is a very high level of engagement for any online community (Deepblu also syncs with Bluetooth-enabled dive computers from major diving gear brands like Scubapro and Tusa or lets members enter data manually).For service providers, one of Planet Deepblu\u2019s value propositions is reaching younger divers. Although scuba divers are passionate about what they do, Tsuei says that in many key markets, including the Caribbean, divers are aging into their sixties, but their kids aren\u2019t following them into the sport.

{"title": ["Atlassian\u2019s two-year cloud journey"], "text": "A couple of years ago, Dropbox shocked a lot of people when it decided to mostly drop the public cloud, and built its own datacenters. More recently, Atlassian did the opposite, closing most of its datacenters and moving to the cloud. Companies make these choices for a variety of reasons. When Atlassian  CTO Sri Viswanath came on board in 2016, he made the decision to move the company\u2019s biggest applications to AWS.In part, this is a story of technical debt \u2014 that\u2019s the concept that over time your applications become encumbered by layers of crusty code, making it harder to update and ever harder to maintain. For Atlassian, which was founded in 2002, that bill came due in 2016 when Viswanath came to work for the company.Atlassian already knew they needed to update the code to move into the future. One of the reasons they brought Viswanath on board was to lead that charge, but the thinking was already in place even before he got there. A small team was formed back in 2015 to work out the vision and the architecture for the new cloud-based approach, but they wanted to have their first CTO in place to carry it through to fruition.He put the plan into motion, giving it the internal code name Vertigo \u2014 maybe because the thought of moving most of their software stack to the public cloud made the engineering team dizzy to even consider. The goal of the project was to rearchitect the software, starting with their biggest products Jira and Confluence, in a such a way that it would lay the foundation for the company for the next decade \u2014 no pressure or anything.They spent a good part of 2016 rewriting the software and getting it set up on AWS. They concentrated on turning their 15-year old code into microservices, which in the end resulted in a smaller code base. He said the technical debt issues were very real, but they had to be careful not to reinvent the wheel, just change what needed to be changed whenever possible.\u201cThe code base was pretty large and we had to go in and do two things. We wanted to build it for multi-tenant architecture and we wanted to create microservices,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was a service that could be pulled out and made self-contained we did that, but we also created new services as part of the process.\u201dLast year was the migration year, and it was indeed a full year-long project to migrate every last customer over to the new system. It started in January and ended in December and involved moving tens of thousands of customers.First of all, they automated whatever they could and they also were very deliberate in terms of the migration order, being conscious of migrations that might be more difficult. \u201cWe were thoughtful in what order to migrate. We didn\u2019t want to do easiest first and hardest at the end. We didn\u2019t want to do just the harder ones and not make progress. We had to blend [our approaches] to fix bugs and issues throughout the project,\u201d he said.Viswanath stated that the overarching goal was to move the customers without a major incident. \u201cIf you talk to anyone who does migration, that\u2019s a big thing. Everyone has scars doing migrations. We were conscious to do this pretty carefully.\u201d Surprisingly, although it wasn\u2019t perfect, they did manage to complete the entire exercise without a major outage, a point of which the team is justifiably proud. That doesn\u2019t mean that it was always smooth or easy.\u201cIt sounds super easy: \u2018we were thoughtful and we migrated,\u2019 but there was warfare every day. When you migrate, you hit a wall and react. It was a daily thing for us throughout the year,\u201d he explained. It took a total team effort involving engineering, product and support. That included having a customer support person involved in the daily scrum meetings so they could get a feel for any issues customers were having and fix them as quickly as possible.As in any cloud project, there are some general benefits to moving an application to the cloud around flexibility, agility and resource elasticity, but there was more than that when it came to this specific project.First of all it has allowed faster deployment with multiple deployments at the same time, due in large part to the copious use of microservices. That means they can add new features much faster. During the migration year, they held off on new features for the most part because they wanted to keep things as static as possible for the shift over, but with the new system in place they can move much more quickly to add new features.They get much better performance and if they hit a performance bottleneck, they can just add more resources because it\u2019s the cloud. What\u2019s more, they were able to have a local presence in the EU and that improves performance by having the applications closer to the end users located there.Finally, they actually found the cloud to be a more economical option, something that not every company that moves to the cloud finds. By closing the datacenters and reducing the capital costs associated with buying hardware and hiring IT personnel to maintain it, they were able to reduce costs.It was a long drawn out project, and as such, they really needed to think about the human aspect of it too. They would swap people in and out to make sure the engineers stayed fresh and didn\u2019t burn out helping with the transition.One thing that helped was the company culture in general, which Viswanath candidly describes as one with open communication and a general \u201cno bullshit\u201d policy. \u201cWe maintained open communication, even when things weren\u2019t going well. People would raise their hand if they couldn\u2019t keep up and we would get them help,\u201d he said.He admitted that there was some anxiety within the company and for him personally implementing a project of this scale, but they knew they needed to do it for the future of the organization. \u201cThere was definitely nervousness on what if this project doesn\u2019t go well. It seemed the obvious right direction and we had to do it. The risk was what if we screwed up in execution and we didn\u2019t realize benefits we set out to do.\u201dIn the end, it was a lot of work, but it worked out just fine and they have the system in place for the future. \u201cNow we are set up for the next 10 years,\u201d he said.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/atlassians-two-year-cloud-journey/"},

{"title": ["Tesla makes Autopilot easier to use in the Model 3"], "text": "The Model 3 now has a new way to control Autopilot. The company recently sent out an update that moved the controls from the center infotainment stack to the steering wheeling. Previously, drivers had to use the large screen to change Autopilot\u2019s  speed and cruise distance and in doing so, required drivers to take their eyes off the road to change these options.The Model 3 is an exercise in minimalism, and to that end, the company is seemingly still working out the best interface. To that end, the controls on the Model 3\u2019s steering wheel were purposely not labeled or dedicated to a specific function and instead change depending on the car\u2019s role.Thanks to the 2018.12 update, the right-hand scroll wheel controls the speed of the vehicle while the buttons flanking that wheel changes the follow distance. The new controls do not replace the existing controls but rather supplement them.During our review of the Model 3, we noted the sparse cockpit design and found it good and bad. On the one hand, it\u2019s terrific to have an unobstructed view of the road \u2013 it\u2019s as pure as driving experience as rolling down the track in the soapbox derby car of your youth, and it leaves you feeling connected to the road itself.

{"title": ["SiFive gets $50.6M to help companies get their custom chip designs out the door"], "text": "With the race to next-generation silicon in full swing, the waterfall of venture money flowing into custom silicon startups is already showing an enormous amount of potential for some more flexible hardware for an increasingly changing technology landscape \u2014 and Naveed Sherwani hopes to tap that for everyone else.That\u2019s the premise of SiFive, a startup that\u2019s designed to help entrepreneurs \u2014 or any company \u2014 come up with a custom designed chip for their needs. But rather than having to raise tens of millions of dollars from a venture firm or have a massive production system in place, SiFive\u2019s  goal is to help get that piece of silicon in the hands of the developer quickly so they can see if it actually works based off a set of basic hardware and IP offered, and then figure out when and how to move it into full-scale production. The company starts by offering templates and then allows them to make some modifications for what eventually ends up as a piece of RISC-V silicon that\u2019s in their hands. SiFive today said it has raised $50.6 million in venture financing in a round led by\u00a0Sutter Hill Ventures, Spark Capital, and Osage University Partners.\u201cThe way we view it, is that we think we should not depend on people learning special languages and things of that nature to be able to modify the architecture and enhance the architecture,\u201d Sherwani said. \u201cWhat we believe is there could be a high-level interface, which is what we\u2019re building, which will allow people to take existing cores, bring them into their design space, and then apply a configuration. Moving those configurations, you can modify the core, and then you can get the new modified core. That\u2019s the approach we take, we don\u2019t have to learn a special language or be an expert, it\u2019s the way we present the core. We\u2019d like to start with cores that are verified, and each of these modifications does not cause to become non-verifiable.\u201dSiFive is based on a design framework for silicon called RISC-V. You could consider it a kind of open source analog to designs by major chip fab firms, but the goal for RISC-V chips is to lean on the decades of experience since the original piece of silicon came out of Intel to develop something that is less messy while still getting the right tasks done. Sherwani says that RISC-V chips have more than 50 instruction sets while common chips will have more than 1,000. By nature, they aren\u2019t at the kind of scale of an Intel, so the kinds of efficiencies those firms might have don\u2019t exist. But SiFive hopes to serve a wide array of varying needs rather than mass-producing a single style of silicon.There are two flows for developers looking to build out silicon using SiFive. First is the prototype flow, where developers will get a chance to spec out their silicon and figure out their specific needs. The goal there is to get something into the hands of the developer they can use to showcase their ideas or technology, and SiFive works with IP vendors and other supply chain partners \u2014 during this time, developers aren\u2019t paying for IP. Once the case is proved out (and the startup has, perhaps, raised money based on that idea) they can switch to a production flow with SiFive where they will start paying for IP and services. There\u2019s also a potential marketplace element as more and more people come up with novel ideas for operational cores.\u201cFor any segment in the market there will be a few templates available,\u201d Sherwani said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have some tools and methodologies there, and among all the various templates are available show what would be the best for [that customer]. We also have an app store \u2014 we are expecting people who have designed cores who are willing to share it, because they don\u2019t need it to be proprietary. If anyone uses that template, then whatever price they can put on it, they can make some money doing that. This whole idea of marketplaces will get more people excited.\u201dAs there is an intense rush to develop new customized silicon, it may be that services like the ones offered by SiFive become more and more necessary. But there\u2019s another element to the bet behind SiFive: making the chip itself less ambiguous and trying to remove black boxes. That doesn\u2019t necessarily make it wildly more secure than the one next to it, but at the very least, it means when there is a major security flaw like Intel\u2019s Spectre problems, there may be a bit more tolerance from the developer community because there are fewer black boxes.\u201cAll these complications are there and unless you have all this expertise, you can\u2019t do a chip,\u201d Sherwani said. \u201cOur vision is that we deliver the entire chip experience to that platform and people can be able to log in. They don\u2019t need a team, any tools, they don\u2019t need FPGAs because all those will be available on the web. As a result the cost goes down because it\u2019s a shared economy, they\u2019re sharing tools, and that is how we think dramatically you can do chips at much lower cost.\u201dWhile there is a lot of venture money flowing into the AI chip space \u2014 with\u00a0many different interpretations of what that hardware looks like \u2014 Sherwani said the benefit of working with SiFive is to be able to rapidly adapt an idea to a changing algorithm. Developers have already proven out a lot of different tools and frameworks, but once a piece of silicon is in production it\u2019s not easy to change on the fly. Should those best practices or algorithms change, developers will have an opportunity to reassess and redesign the chip as quickly as possible.The idea of that custom silicon is going to be a big theme going forward as more and more use cases emerge that could be easier with a customized piece of hardware. Already there are startups like Mythic  and SambaNova Systems, which have raised tens of millions of dollars and specialize in the rapid-fire calculations for typical AI processes. But this kind of technology is now showing up in devices ranging from an autonomous vehicle to a fridge, and each use case may carry different needs. Intel and other chip design firms probably can\u2019t hit every niche, and the one-size-fits-all (or even something more modular like an FPGA from Intel) might not hit each sweet spot. That, in theory, is the hole that a company like SiFive could fill.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/sifive-gets-50-6m-to-help-companies-get-their-custom-chip-designs-out-the-door/"},

(other than a potential trillion-dollar market)"], "text": "Over the past few days, the Chinese government announced the potential creation of a new trillion-dollar investment market, and it isn\u2019t an April Fools\u2019 joke.China\u2019s tech giants like Alibaba  and Tencent are some of the most valuable in the world, and upcoming potential IPOs by the next generation of startups like Xiaomi are causes for celebration. Most Chinese citizens would be thrilled, however, there is a deep irony behind their success. These Chinese tech companies can actually not be purchased on a Chinese stock exchange, nor can Chinese retail investors buy a share in them.Chinese workers build these companies up, and the value accretes to American capitalists (\u201cSocialism with Chinese Characteristics,\u201d I guess?)Now, the central government is proposing new rules that would allow these companies to come back to the mainland through the use of Chinese Depositary Receipts, or CDRs. That\u2019s big news, and could completely transform not only the market caps of some of the largest tech companies in the world, but also increase competition between trading houses like the New York Stock Exchange and Chinese stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen.WTF is a CDR then? Before we get to that, we first need to understand why they are needed in the first place.In economics theory, stock exchanges are epitomized as a shining exemplar of the notions of free trade and efficient markets. Each company is selling a standard unit (a share), prices are transparently disclosed and buyers and sellers can connect in a central market (an exchange) to buy and sell their securities at voluntary prices.In reality of course, governments strongly regulate financial securities to ensure that those exchanges are well-ordered. The Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States is just one of several public and private bodies that regulate the conduct and operation of the nation\u2019s exchanges.Now up that regulation by 100x when you enter China. Listing on a stock exchange must be approved by the central government, and regulators have been aggressive in blocking listings over the past few years. Due to robust capital controls, Chinese citizens may only buy local securities, and can\u2019t invest in companies outside of China through foreign stock exchanges. Likewise, foreign investors face daunting challenges in investing in local companies, even with liberalization programs over the last two decades. The government regularly intervenes in the operation of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges through trade freezes and other machinations. Local securities regulations can be highly burdensome, and force companies to engage in \u201cparty building\u201d activities.For Chinese companies looking to raise capital from private investors, there are two paths forward. One is to offer multiple types of shares traded in different places. Classically, this has meant an \u201cA-share\u201d that was traded in say Shanghai and only available for purchase by locals, and a \u201cB-share\u201d that was only available to foreigners. Some companies chose to have an \u201cH-share,\u201d which was listed in Hong Kong, which has none of the securities regulations of domestic Chinese exchanges. These different classes of shares are priced independently, and there can be wide discrepancies between them (A-shares have traditionally had massive premiums compared to other share types, and researchers still don\u2019t know exactly why).This path is convoluted, so large Chinese companies \u2014 including Alibaba and Tencent \u2014 are often incorporated in places like the Cayman Islands to avoid domestic securities requirements, while also giving them access to foreign capital markets. According to an analysis by offshore incorporation specialist law firm Walkers, nearly half of all Hong Kong-listed stocks are based in the Cayman Islands, with another quarter based in Bermuda. That is financially prudent for executives, but deeply unpopular with Chinese authorities, which both loses corporate control and also loses the future growth that these stocks attain when they list on a foreign exchange.That\u2019s where Chinese Depositary Receipts (CDRs) come in. Modeled after American Depositary Receipts, which were invented almost a century ago, CDRs are a way for local buyers to own foreign shares in a way that both fits within local securities regulations and reduces friction in the trading process.A bank acts as a middleman broker between a foreign issuer and local buyers. This institution, known as the depositary, holds foreign shares of companies in trust, and then offers a new security to the local market linked to those deposited shares by a ratio (say one receipt per six shares). We now have two securities: the receipt, held by a shareholder which is connected to a depositary bank, and the original foreign share, which is held by the bank on behalf of a foreign issuer.This is where the \u201cmagic\u201d happens: Securities regulations apply to the new security targeting local buyers, and not to the shares of the original company (massive asterisk here since the reality is thousands of pages of policies and laws, but this is the general idea). By intermediating the transaction, everyone can win: Local buyers get access to foreign investments, while also still coming under the purview of domestic regulations.It\u2019s important to note that there are a bunch of peculiarities that I don\u2019t want to dive too much into. There are more fees than standard shares in order to pay for custody of the shares and the trading logistics to maintain them. There are tax implications and other accounting issues that can be quite complex depending on the investor.Despite such complications though, depositary receipts are quite popular in the United States. The market in 2016 was worth an estimated $2.9 trillion, with roughly 3,500 such securities available to be traded, and dozens more launched that year,\u00a0according to BNY Mellon, which is among the largest depositary bank institutions in the country. Given that the Chinese economy is already larger than America\u2019s today by some economic measures, the scale of a CDR market could well pass a trillion dollars.The concept behind depositary receipts may not be new, but their use in China has not previously been formalized, and that is liable to change now. This past Friday, the central government circulated a draft policy of new securities regulations that would allow for Chinese Depositary Receipts to be issued on local stock exchanges.According to China Banking News, tech companies look like the major focus here. \u201cThe Opinions will allow some tech companies or enterprises in strategic emerging industries to perform listing via the issuance of either shares or depository receipts, with a focus on sectors including big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, software, integrated circuits, high-end manufacturing and bio-tech.\u201d That focus on technology would match other initiatives of the Chinese Communist Party, namely the country\u2019s roadmap for technological dominance, known as Made in China 2025.Once the CDR mechanism is in place, Chinese companies listed overseas are expected to face significant pressure to utilize it and open up their ownership to local buyers. Already, companies like Baidu, Sogou, Alibaba, Tencent and Xiaomi have said publicly that they are interested in finding a channel to return to the mainland (or in the case of Xiaomi, to potentially launch its initial offering at least partially there). As Bloomberg wrote a month ago, \u201cEnticing mega-corporations to list locally will help burnish the reputation of China\u2019s twin bourses in Shanghai and Shenzhen, notorious for spotty regulation, volatility and periodic government intervention.\u201dFurthermore, having more domestic Chinese shareholders ensures that corporate control of these local companies stays in Chinese hands. The Chinese Communist Party has been particularly aggressive on this front, proposing taking a point of equity in top firms and potentially installing party cadres on corporate boards. Changing the shareholder structure of these firms then should be seen as an extension of control by the party into the private sector.While the changes are still being promulgated, we should be prepared for large changes in the ways that companies \u2014 particularly those in the technology sector \u2014 are capitalized. Alibaba and Tencent\u2019s combined market cap is nearly a trillion dollars. There are dozens of other Chinese stocks listed exclusively in U.S. and Western exchanges, so if CDRs become popular, it could be a massive market. Expect CDRs to be a major news story for the remainder of the year as final regulations are published.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/wtf-are-cdrs/"},

Today, FB showcased some big new changes to the avatar system in Spaces that switches up the visual style quite a bit.The avatar system is a lot more three-dimensional in that the faces no longer seem to be blank canvases with 2D features slapped onto them. The evolution isn\u2019t necessarily skewing more toward realism as much as it is toward more emotion that can come off in a less cartoon-like way.Facebook Spaces probably doesn\u2019t have any crazy usage numbers, so it\u2019s interesting to see the company refine things to this degree.\u00a0On an anecdotal basis, I\u2019ve only seen this feature pop up in my feed a couple of times, and quite a few of my FB friends work in virtual reality, so that should be a bit telling.That does make one question whether Facebook would ever look to integrate the avatar system into features outside of VR. Facebook says they are continuing to make these changes compatible with their machine learning-powered avatar creation tool, which takes recent photos of you and suggests appropriate avatars that you can use as starting points. This seems like something Facebook could easily integrate into a Bitmoji competitor if they ever choose to.The new system integrates more customization options so that users can dial in their look to make things more similar to how they themselves look in real life, which seems to be how Facebook would prefer you use this system. There seems to be a particularly large amount of progress in how users can dial in face shape and hairstyles. Notably, users are also able to change their body size for the first time, rather than all being the same thin size.Avatars being creepy is kind of a given, though I\u2019m not sure Facebook is lessening the creepiness any in this update\u2026The new avatar looks will be rolling out in Facebook Spaces over the next week, the company says.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/facebook-shows-off-a-new-avatar-system-but-its-still-just-for-vr/"},
{"title": ["82Labs raises $8M to create a better hangover recovery drink"], "text": "While taking some time off to travel before his next gig, Sisun Lee spent a lot of time in Korea \u2014 where he found himself drinking alcohol pretty much every night and then getting rolling the next morning, regardless of hangover status.He also found that there were popular local herbal hangover drinks that everyone kept raving about. So he brought a bunch of them back to the U.S., handed them out to friends, and generally got interested in the drink as a thought experiment. After reaching out to scientists in academia about the herbal drinks and finding no one had really commercialized it into a product in the U.S. \u2014 and that there might\u00a0actually be something behind the idea \u2014 he decided to start 82Labs and roll out the Morning Recovery drink. The startup has also raised $8 million in new financing from Altos Ventures, Slow Ventures, Strong Ventures and Thunder Road Capital.\u201cMy friends would go to work the next day and they would swear by these hangover drinks with an herbal base,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn many ways that was almost when I was first inspired by it. That was at the back of my head. It turned out it was a massive market, it wasn\u2019t one major brand \u2014 all the CPG companies had their own brand. It\u2019s like the energy drink market. I did some research, and [people in academia]\u00a0might be really passionate about something, and give you this conviction that this is the next big thing, but they wouldn\u2019t commercialize it. They didn\u2019t know how to get going.\u201dThe drink is based on a flavonoid component of popular herbal medicines called DHM. The original concept for the drink was also based on research on DHM from USC, where Lee had gotten in touch with the scientists working on it to see if the idea was actually worth pursuing. That\u2019s then bottled with other components like vitamins, electrolytes, milk thistle and some others which are known to have some detoxifying components. 82Labs  initially launched in August, but at the time was literally handing out white powder in little bags \u2014 something Lee wasn\u2019t particularly thrilled about. But as more and more interest came in after handing it out to area friends (and product managers) throughout the course of an unscientific experiment, they decided to roll with it and try to turn it into the kind of market you\u2019d find abroad.Lee and his friends decided to create a website to start sending it out for free for anyone who was interested in signing up. They made a few hundred bottles, gave it a flavor, and put a sign-up sheet online where they would ship it to you. Naturally, however, this is Silicon Valley, so the site ended up going viral and they got so many requests that they needed to figure out what to do next because larger bottling orders came in the tens of thousands. After some work figuring out how they could actually get it to market abiding by rules and regulations by the FDA, the team ended up making an Indiegogo campaign, which raised more than $250,000\u201cBecause of our margins, every user we onboard is profit we generate,\u201d Lee. \u201cBut we\u2019ve had to learn a lot really quickly. The big thing for us last year was a big production mistake and we were always supply constrained every order. Sometimes we had compliance issues, quality issues, or mistakes on timeline. everything has been around putting out fires and making sure customers are happy, or giving them refunds December was the first month we had inventory and started to sell during holiday season when people are drinking a lot. We really never had time to think and go, \u201choly crap, what are we actually doing, what\u2019s the goal here, what\u2019s the mission here.\u201dLee said that while Morning Recovery, which costs $30 for a six-pack of the 3.4-ounce drink, is their first drink they don\u2019t want to just stop there. After all, getting a successful beverage to market \u2014 even if it turns out there\u2019s plenty of work to do on the science side \u2014 requires getting into retail outlets and into the hands of consumers. But if that\u2019s successful, that could easily build a brand and help the company start thinking about the next product that they should make. That direct-to-consumer approach has been increasingly popular amid the success of companies like Dollar Shave Club and others.But that also means that 82Labs will likely face a lot of challenges, especially if it starts to get traction and larger companies start to take notice of it. Since the market is popular internationally \u2014 Lee says it\u2019s a few hundred million dollars annually in countries like Korea \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t take much for a consumer packaged goods company with beverage experience to try to produce something similar. So the goal will be to build up enough traction before that happens in order to continue growing.\u201cIf big companies take notice, while they can\u2019t make the exact same product as us, I\u2019m sure they can figure something out,\u201d\u00a0 Lee said. \u201cWe have the advantage of a couple months \u2014 once we get to at a threshold in revenue companies will probably notice us. We thought we could keep growing slowly, but if any of these pharmaceutical companies or CPG companies do something, we\u2019re gonna be crushed. Or, we thought we would raise money to front-load expansion purely on growth.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-02 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/82labs-raises-8m-to-create-a-better-hangover-recovery-drink/"},

Project North Star\u00a0is just a prototype reference design, but the company is open-sourcing its schematics and, despite the fact that it makes the wearer look like a giant bug, it seems fairly interesting.The startup says that the low-cost headset can be built for under $100 at scale. The savings here versus other AR headset systems relies on the simplicity of the optical system which promises a high quality experience in a form factor that\u2019s hardly low-key but is on-par with the bulk we\u2019re used to seeing in most of today\u2019s ugly VR headsets.

This extension follows an order from the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) made over the weekend, and it now means that Uber\u2019s app will cease running in the country on\u00a0April 16.Elsewhere, Grab shuttered the Uber app in its six other markets in Southeast Asia  today as planned,\u00a0two weeks after the merger deal was confirmed. As for\u00a0UberEats, that app\u00a0will live on in the region until the end of May, after which it will be folded into GrabFood.It appears that Grab didn\u2019t count on Southeast Asia\u2019s regulators being so intent to probe\u00a0the tie-up.The Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) said\u00a0last month that it\u00a0had \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to suspect that the deal may fall foul of section 54 of Singapore\u2019s Competition Act, while the PCC voiced similar concerns last week.\u201cThis move by Uber in the Philippine market leads to further substantial concentration of what is, to begin with, an already highly concentrated ride-sharing market. This virtual monopolization of the market by Grab can harm the riding public,\u201d the organization\u2019s chairman\u00a0Arsenio M.

{"title": ["Facebook urged to make GDPR its \u201cbaseline standard\u201d globally"], "text": "Facebook  is facing calls from consumer groups to make the European Union\u2019s incoming GDPR data protection framework the \u201cbaseline standard for all Facebook services\u201d.The update to the bloc\u2019s data protection  framework is intended to strengthen consumers\u2019 control over how their personal data is used by bolstering transparency and consent requirements, and beefing up penalties for data breaches and privacy violations.In an open letter addressed to founder Mark Zuckerberg, a coalition of US and EU consumer and privacy rights groups urges the company to \u201cconfirm your company\u2019s commitment to global compliance with the GDPR and provide specific details on how the company plans to implement these changes in your testimony before the US Congress this week\u201d.The letter is written by the Trans Atlantic Consumer Dialogue, and co-signed by\u00a0Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy in the US and\u00a0Finn L\u00fctzow-Holm Myrstad, the head of the digital services section at the Norwegian Consumer Council.\u201cThe GDPR helps ensure that companies such as yours operate in an accountable and transparent manner, subject to the rule of law and the democratic process,\u201d they write. \u201cThe GDPR provides a solid foundation for data protection, establishing clear responsibilities for companies that collect personal data and clear rights for users whose data is gathered. These are protections that all users should be entitled to no matter where they are located.\u201cWe favor the continued growth of the digital economy and we strongly support innovation. The unregulated collection and use of personal data threatens this future. Data breaches, identity theft, cyber-attack, and financial fraud are all on the rise. The vast collection of personal data has also diminished competition. And the targeting of internet users, based on detailed and secret profiling with opaque algorithms, threatens not only consumer privacy  but also democratic institutions.\u201dZuckerberg caused confusion about Facebook\u2019s intentions towards GDPR last week when he refused to confirm whether the company would apply the same compliance measures for users in North America \u2014 suggesting domestic and Canadian Facebookers, whose data is processed in the US, rather than Ireland (where its international HQ is based), would be subject to lower privacy standards than all other users (whose data is processed within the EU) after May 25 when GDPR comes into force.In a subsequent conference call with reporters, Zuckerberg further fogged the issue by saying Facebook intends to \u201cmake all the same controls available everywhere, not just in Europe\u201d \u2014 yet he went on to caveat that by adding: \u201cIs it going to be exactly the same format? Probably not. We\u2019ll need to figure out what makes sense in different markets with different laws in different places.\u201dPrivacy experts were quick to point out that \u201ccontrols and settings\u201d are just one component of the data protection regulation. If Facebook is truly going to apply GDPR universally it will need to give every Facebook user the same high privacy and data protection standards that GDPR mandates for EU citizens \u2014 such as by providing users with the right to view, amend and delete personal data it holds on them; and the right to obtain a copy of this personal data in a portable format.Facebook does currently provide some user data on request \u2014 but this is by no means comprehensive. For example it only provides an eight-week snapshot of information to users about which advertisers have told it they have a user\u2019s consent to process their information.In denying a more fulsome fulfillment of what\u2019s known in Europe as a \u2018subject access request\u2019, the company told one requester, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, the co-founder of PersonalData.IO, that it would involve \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d to fulfill his request \u2014 invoking an exception in Irish law in order to circumvent current EU privacy laws.\u201c[Facebook] are really arguing \u2018we are too big to comply with data protection law\u2019,\u201d\u00a0Dehaye told a UK parliamentary committee last month, discussing how difficult it has been to get the company to divulge information it holds about him. \u201cThe costs would be too high for us. Which is mindboggling that they wouldn\u2019t see the direction they\u2019re going there. Do they really want to make that argument?\u201dWhether that situation changes once GDPR is in force remains to be seen.The new framework at least introduces a regime of much larger penalties for privacy violations \u2014 beefing up enforcement with maximum fines of up to 4% of a company\u2019s global annual turnover. So the legal risks of trying to circumvent EU data protection law will inflate substantially in just over a month.And Facebook has already made some changes ahead of GDPR coming into force (and likely to try to comply with the new standard) \u2014 announcing it\u2019s shutting down a partnership with major offline and online data brokers, for example.\u201cConsumer groups and privacy groups, human rights groups, civil rights groups will all probably be watching how GDPR is implemented,\u201d Finn L\u00fctzow-Holm Myrstad tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd will be ready to probably go to court to establish that these are fundamental rights for European citizens at the moment. So we\u2019re definitely going to pay attention.\u201cBut obviously we really want the industry to work with us and to take this seriously because if they don\u2019t there will be a very negative spiral of court cases and a chilling effect for consumers because they will be afraid of using these services. And they will be caught in the middle because of the lack of options that they have when it comes to these services. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for anyone. So we really hope that this is sign of change \u2014 real change \u2014 from Facebook.\u201dThe company remains under huge pressure following revelations about how much Facebook user information was passed to a controversial political consultancy, Cambridge Analytica, by a developer using its platform to deploy a quiz app as a vehicle for harvesting personal data without most users\u2019 knowledge or consent.Facebook has said as many as 87M users could have had their data passed to Cambridge Analytica as a result of them or their friends downloading the app in 2014.Zuckerberg is due to give testimony on this and likely wider issues related to privacy and data protection on his platform to US politicians this week.One line of questioning might well focus on why Facebook has so studiously ignored years of warnings that it was not adequately locking down access to user data on its platform.The Norwegian Consumer Council actually filed a complaint about Facebook app permissions all the way back in 2010, writing\u00a0presciently then: \u201cThird-party applications should only be given access to the information they need in order to function. Facebook should not be able to renounce responsibility for the way in which third parties collect, store or use personal data. As a facilitator and operator Facebook must take direct responsibility for the applications available on the platform.\u201dMyrstad says Facebook\u2019s historical response to these sort of privacy complaints has been \u201csadly very, very little\u201d.On the contrary, he says the company has made it \u201creally, really difficult to opt out of their tracking, their profiling\u201d.\u00a0He also describes Facebook\u2019s default settings as \u201ca nightmare\u201d for people to understand. In terms of GDPR compliance, he says he believes Facebook will need to make changes to their business model and alter default settings \u2014 at very least for users whose data gets processed via Facebook Ireland.\u201cThey will definitely need to have much better consent mechanisms than they do today. Much less take it or leave it,\u201d says Myrstad. \u201cI think there will be a discussion also in Europe, and I think it\u2019s not yet written in stone yet how this will turn out, but we definitely also think that the amount of tracking that Facebook does by default on other websites will need an actual explicit consent \u2014 which there is not today. It\u2019s not possible to opt out of the tracking.\u201cYou can opt out of behavioral advertising but that\u2019s not the same as opting out from tracking. And I think the way they do that today is not in line with GDPR\u2026 I think they will actually struggle [to comply]. They\u2019re already struggling under current law in Europe. So they will need to make some fundamental changes to their business model.\u201dAt the time of writing Facebook had not responded to a request for comment.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/facebook-urged-to-make-gdpr-its-baseline-standard-globally/"},

Today, the IoT security startup announced a $30 million Series B.The company has attracted a strong group of venture capitalists. The round was led by Bain Capital Ventures and Red Dot Capital. Sequoia Capital and Tenaya Capital, who were investors in earlier rounds, also participated. Today\u2019s investment brings the total raised to $47 million.The company secures IoT devices without an agent because it\u2019s often impossible to put an agent on a connected device like a video camera, light bulb or sensor. That requires some knowledge of these devices and their expected behavior and Armis  has created a growing database of more than 5 million devices to track this information.Company co-founder and CEO Yevgeny Dibrov says it involves taking that database and combining it with other information about the environment in which the device operates to understand if it\u2019s behaving in an expected fashion. When it\u2019s not they may shut it down and alert the customer, depending on how it\u2019s configured and how severe the problem appears to be.\u201cTo build and agentless platform, we [look at] existing infrastructure, traffic, wireless infrastructure and network infrastructure, to get a huge amount of traffic information. We analyze and detect and get a fingerprint of every device and asset in the environment and leverage the 5 million devices in the knowledge base,\u201d he said.It\u2019s an approach that attracted investor Jeff Williams, operating partner at Bain Capital Ventures. Williams said he has been researching the IoT security market and has been seeing explosive growth in connected devices, which he sees creating a new attack surface for the enterprise. \u201cArmis\u2019 ability to help enterprises discover, manage and secure these devices is what companies today need to get in front of protecting the new era of IoT. All these forces, plus the pedigree of Armis\u2019 executive team and their impressive research division are setting Armis up for powerful growth,\u201d he said.And the company is growing quickly with dozens of customers and 50 employees. The startup\u2019s R&D team is 35 strong and is located in Israel, while the remaining employees with a focus on sales and marketing are located in the US.As the number of IoT devices proliferate in the enterprise, the company will devote a portion of today\u2019s money to increasing their R&D budget to continue building the database of devices.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/armis-raises-30-million-series-b-as-enterprise-iot-security-heats-up/"},

Benioff said he went to every venture capital in Silicon Valley \u2014 and was turned down every single time.This could be a lesson for every startup out there with a vision, who is not able to find conventional financing for your idea. Salesforce  found the money, but it took one on one fundraising, rather than the traditional VC route.The company famously launched in an apartment that Benioff rented, and he put up some of his own money to buy the company\u2019s first computers. Then it was time to go downtown and ask the VCs for money and it did not go well.\u201cI had to go hat in hand, like I was a high tech beggar, down to Silicon Valley to raise some money\u2026And as I go from venture capitalist to venture capitalist to venture capitalist \u2014 and a lot of them are my friends, people I\u2019ve gone to lunch with \u2014 and each and every one of them said no,\u201d Benioff said. \u201cSalesforce was never able to raise a single dollar from a venture capitalist,\u201d he added.He suggested there were a lot of reasons for that including competitors who would call after his meetings and deliberately sabotage him or people who simply didn\u2019t believe in the cloud as a vision of the future of software.Whatever the reasons, Salesforce was eventually able to raise over $60 million from private individual investors, before going public in 2004.\u00a0In the context of today\u2019s venture capital environment, it is pretty tough to imagine a guy like Benioff not finding one taker, especially when you consider that he was not exactly an unknown quantity. And still no one would write him a check.But this wasn\u2019t now. It was in the late 1990s when nobody was thinking about cloud computing and the notion of software on the internet was a distant idea. Benioff was imagining something completely different and not one firm had the vision to see what was coming. Today, Salesforce is a $10 billion company and those folks that turned him down have to be wondering what they were thinking.\u201cWhen you start something like Salesforce, you want to surround yourself with people who do believe in you, who do believe you\u2019re going to be successful because you\u2019re going to have a whole bunch of people who are going to tell you that you\u2019re not, Benioff said.That\u2019s something every entrepreneur should remember.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/benioff-every-vc-in-silicon-valley-turned-us-down/"},
{"title": ["Uber acquires bike-share startup JUMP"], "text": "Uber has acquired bike-sharing startup JUMP for an undisclosed amount of money. This comes shortly after TechCrunch reported that JUMP was in talks\u00a0with Uber  as well as with investors regarding a potential fundraising round involving Sequoia Capital\u2019s Mike Moritz. At the time, JUMP was contemplating a sale that exceeded $100 million. We\u2019re now hearing that the final price was closer to $200 million, according to one source close to the situation.JUMP\u2019s decision to sell to Uber came down to the ability to realize the bike-share company\u2019s vision at a large scale, and quickly, JUMP CEO Ryan Rzepecki told TechCrunch over the phone. He also said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi\u2019s leadership impacted his decision.\u201cI had a chance to spend a couple of evenings with him, and really talk through his vision for the business and our vision, and saw a lot of alignment,\u201d Rzepecki said.He noted that while Uber had a rocky 2017, he\u2019s optimistic Uber is on the right track.\u201cI think it\u2019s really on the right course now and [Khosrowshahi] believes the way we approach working with cities and our vision for partnering with cities\u201d aligns with Uber\u2019s mission, Rzepecki said. \u201cThat was important for me and his desire to do things the right way. This is a great outcome and gives me a chance to bring my entire vision to the entire world.\u201dMeanwhile, becoming a top urban mobility platform is part of Uber\u2019s ultimate vision, Khosrowshahi told TechCrunch over the phone. As more people live in cities, there will need to be a broader array of mobility options that work for both customers and cities, he said.\u201cWe see the Uber app as moving from just being about car sharing and car hailing to really helping the consumer get from A to B int he most affordable, most dependable, most convenient way,\u201d Khosrowshahi said. \u201cAnd we think e-bikes are just a spectacularly great product.\u201dAs part of the acquisition, JUMP employees will join Uber\u2019s team but the bike-share company will carry on as an independent, wholly controlled subsidiary, Rzepecki said.JUMP is best known for operating dockless, pedal-assist bikes. JUMP\u2019s bikes can be legally locked to bike parking racks or the \u201cfurniture zone\u201d of sidewalks, which is where you see things like light poles, benches and utility poles. The bikes also come with integrated locks to secure the bikes.Uber\u2019s acquisition of JUMP is not too surprising. In January, Uber partnered with JUMP to launch Uber Bike, which lets Uber riders book JUMP bikes via the Uber app. The majority of trips, however, still come through the JUMP app, Rzepecki said.\u00a0For the time being, JUMP\u2019s app will continue to exist but that may eventually change.\u201cIt\u2019s our hope the experience will be more deeply integrated into the Uber app moving forward and reflects what Uber has been working on in terms of being a multi-modal platform,\u201d Rzepecki said.Meanwhile, Uber\u2019s international competitors have made similar moves. India-based ride-hailing startup expanded into bicycles in December. Called Ola Pedal, the service is available on a handful of university campuses in India. Then there\u2019s Southeast Asia\u2019s Grab and China\u2019s Didi, which both launched their own respective bike-share services this year. Both Didi and Grab have also invested directly in bike-sharing startups Ofo\u00a0and OBike, respectively.With JUMP under the ownership of Uber, we likely won\u2019t see JUMP partner with any of Uber\u2019s direct competitors, but Rzepecki said other types of partnerships could be interesting.\u201cI think the idea of us being inside the Lyft app is not necessarily likely but there may be other partnerships that we\u2019re able to do that are less directly competitive,\u201d Rzepecki said.In January, JUMP closed a $10 million Series A round led by Menlo Ventures with participation from Sinewave Ventures, Esther Dyson and others. JUMP\u2019s January funding brought its total amount raised to $11.1 million.\u00a0That same month, JUMP\u00a0became the first stationless bicycle service to receive a permit to launch in San Francisco. Since then, JUMP has launched 250 dockless, pedal-assist bikes on the streets of San Francisco. Currently, people take between six to seven rides per day, with an average trip length of 2.6 miles, Rzepecki said.\u201cWe really know we are serving a commute,\u201d Rzepecki said. \u201cWe\u2019re serving the morning and evening commute. I think 22 percent of trips are in the morning and 20 percent in the evening commute. We\u2019ve really been a commuting solution.\u201dIn October, the SFMTA will determine if JUMP can deploy an additional 250 bikes. The SFMTA will make its decision based on an evaluation of the program\u2019s first nine months. That evaluation, the SFMTA told TechCrunch in January, will entail determining where the city should promote stationless bike-share, the impact stationless bike-share has on the public right-of-way, \u201cincluding maintaining accessible pedestrian paths of travel, as well as the enforcement/maintenance burden on city staff.\u201dJUMP also operates its e-bike network in Washington D.C., and plans to launch in\u00a0Sacramento\u00a0and\u00a0Providence, Rhode Island\u00a0later this year.\u00a0Through its software and hardware offerings, it operates via third-parties, like cities, campuses and corporations, in 40 markets including Portland, New Orleans and Atlanta. JUMP is also interested in deploying its bikes in Europe, where it hopes to be by spring of 2019. JUMP has also applied for a permit to operate in New York, which recently legalized electric, pedal-assist bikes.E-bikes, of course, are not the only way to get around town these days. This year, we\u2019ve seen a number of startups launch electric scooters. While\u00a0San Francisco is trying to figure out how to regulate them,\u00a0people are watching closely to see what comes next.Khosrowshahi is one of those people. He told me he\u2019s been \u201cstaring at some of them quizzically on the streets.\u201dScooters are in an \u201codd spot\u201d due to the lack of regulation, Khosrowshahi said, but Uber will \u201clook at any and all options\u201d that \u201cmove in a direction that is city friendly.\u201dAlso, be sure to check out my interview with Rzepecki from January on CTRL+T.Additional reporting by Katie Roof.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/uber-acquires-bike-share-startup-jump/"},

Specifically, the groups say YouTube is violating COPPA, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, which requires that websites directed at children under the age of 13 get parental consent before they\u2019re allowed to collect children\u2019s data. YouTube doesn\u2019t do this, the complaint says.Technically, YouTube\u2019s site is aimed at those users 13 and older, its terms state. That\u2019s how it gets around having to abide by child privacy laws. But the complaint points to several examples of how the site is clearly targeting younger children, including its hosting of cartoon videos, nursery rhymes, and toy ads. Some of the most popular channels on YouTube are also those aimed at young kids,like ChuChu TV Nursery Rhymes & Kids Songs, which has 15.9 million subscribers and over 10 billion channel views, and LittleBabyBum, which has 14.6 million subscribers and over 14 billion channel views.Plus, advertisers can target kids\u2019 programming through the \u201cParenting and Family\u201d lineup in the Google Preferred ads platform, the complaint states.\u201cGoogle has acted duplicitously by falsely claiming in its terms of service that YouTube is only for those who are age 13 or older, while it deliberately lured young people into an ad-filled digital playground,\u201d said Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy, one of the groups who signed the complaint, in a statement. \u201cJust like Facebook, Google has focused its huge resources on generating profits instead of protecting privacy.\u201dThe groups have a point. The proliferation of children\u2019s\u2019 videos on YouTube and the potential harm that came from having them mixed in with more adult-oriented content is what led YouTube to launch the YouTube Kids app several years ago. So it\u2019s hard to argue, simply, that \u201cYouTube is not for kids.\u201dHowever, even that YouTube Kids has come under fire in recent days because it doesn\u2019t fully protect children from inappropriate videos, including those that took advantage of YouTube\u2019s algorithms for suggested videos, in order to attract views to their shady and sometimes downright disturbing content.YouTube has tried to crack down on these videos and demonetize them, but inappropriate content continues to slip through \u2013 most recently, with\u00a0conspiracy videos suggested to children. Now the company is reportedly preparing to release a version of the YouTube Kids app without the algorithmic suggestions.YouTube pointed to the creation the Kids app in response to the groups\u2019 complaint, according to CNET\u2019s report, saying the app was built for younger viewers because YouTube itself is \u201cnot for children.\u201dBut the advocacy groups say that\u2019s not true. The same content is available both on YouTube Kids and YouTube.com, and the latter benefits from the ability to collect data without having to play by the rules.\u201cKids have been watching videos on YouTube for years, something the company has known, and profited off of, by targeting content and ads at children under 13. It is time for Google to be completely transparent with all the facts and institute fundamentally responsible new policies moving forward to protect the privacy of kids,\u201d said James P. Steyer, CEO of Common Sense.\u00a0\u201cWe fully expect Google to work closely with advocates and reach out to parents with information about parental controls, content, and collection practices on YouTube so parents can make informed choices about what content they allow their kids to access and how to protect their privacy,\u201d he added.The complaint arrives at a time when there\u2019s a heightened awareness and concern over the data collection and data privacy practices of major tech companies in the U.S.,as well as how those systems can be compromised by foreign governments. Most notably, the news cycle is focused on Facebook\u2019s involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal\u00a0which will see CEO Mark Zuckerberg having to testify before Congress. But YouTube, too, has had issues with Russian trolls spreading propaganda on its site, like they had done on Facebook and Twitter.The combination of the poor data privacy practices across social media, abuse of social media platforms by foreign actors, YouTube\u2019s misbehaving algorithms, and its other missteps with regard to its approach with children, may have this complaint taken more seriously than those in the past.Others who signed the complaint include:Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood (CCFC), Berkeley Media Studies Group; Center for Media Justice; Common Sense; Consumer Action; Consumer Federation of America; Consumer Federation of California; Consumers Union, the advocacy division of Consumer Reports; Consumer Watchdog; Corporate Accountability; Defending the Early Years; Electronic Privacy Information Center (\u201cEPIC\u201d); New Dream; Obligation, Inc.; Parent Coalition for Student Privacy; Parents Across America; Parents Television Council; Privacy Rights Clearinghouse; Public Citizen; The Story of Stuff Project; TRUCE (Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Childhood Entertainment); and USPIRG.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/over-20-advocacy-groups-complain-to-ftc-that-youtube-is-violating-childrens-privacy-law/"},
{"title": ["Bots on Twitter share two-thirds of links to popular websites: Pew"], "text": "It\u2019s official: Bots are doing a lot of PR grunt work on Twitter  \u2014 especially when it comes to promoting porn websites.That perhaps unsurprising conclusion about what automated Twitter accounts are link sharing comes courtesy of a new study by the Pew\u00a0Research Center which set out to quantify one aspect of bot-based activity in the Twittersphere.Specifically the researchers wanted to know what proportion of tweeted links to popular websites are posted by automated accounts, rather than by human users?The answer they came up with is that around two-thirds of tweeted links to popular websites are posted by bots rather than humans.The researchers say they were interested in trying to understand a bit more about how information spreads on Twitter. Though for this study they didn\u2019t try to delve directly into more tricky (and sticky) questions about bots \u2014 like whether the information being spread by these robots is actually disinformation .Pew\u2019s researchers also didn\u2019t try to determine whether the automated link PR activity actually led to significant levels of human engagement with the content in question. (Something that can be difficult for external researchers to determine because Twitter does not provide full access to how it shapes the visibility of tweets on its platform, nor data on how individual users are making use of controls and settings that can influence what they see or don\u2019t on its platform).So, safe to say, many bot-related questions remain to be robustly investigated.But here at least is another tidbit of intel about what automated accounts are up to vis-a-vis major media websites \u2014 although, as always, these results are qualified as \u2018suspected bots\u2019 as a consequence of how difficult it is to definitively identify whether an online entity is human or not. (Pew used Indiana University\u2019s Botometer\u00a0machine learning tool for identifying suspected bots; relying on a score of 0.43 or higher to declare likely automation \u2014 based on a series of their own validation exercises.)Pew\u2019s top-line conclusion is that suspected automated accounts played a prominent role in tweeting out links to content across the Twitter ecosystem \u2014 with an estimated 66% of all tweeted links to the most popular websites likely posted by automated accounts, rather than human users.The researchers determined website popularity by first conducting an analysis of 1.2 million English-language tweets containing links (pulling random sample tweet data via Twitter\u2019s streaming API) \u2014 which they boiled down to a list of\u00a02,315 popular sites, i.e. once duplicates and dead links were weeded out.They then categorized these into content domains, with any links that pointed to any other content on Twitter (i.e. rather than externally) collected into a single Twitter.com category.After that they were able to compare how (suspected) bots vs (probable) humans were sharing different categories of content.Below are the results for content being PRed by suspected bots \u2014 as noted above it\u2019s unsurprisingly dominated by adult content. Though bots were found to be responsive for the majority of link shares to popular websites across the category board. Ergo, robots are already doing a major amount of PR grunt work\u2026\u00a0(Looking at that, a good general rule of thumb seems to be that if a Twitter account is sharing links to porn sites it\u2019s probably not human. Or, well, it\u2019s a human\u2019s account that\u2019s been hacked.)The researchers also found that a relatively small number of automated accounts were responsible for a substantial share of the links to popular media outlets on Twitter. \u201cThe 500 most-active suspected bot accounts alone were responsible for 22% of all the links to these news and current events sites over the period in which this study was conducted. By contrast, the 500 most-active human accounts were responsible for just 6% of all links to such sites,\u201d they write.Clearly bots aren\u2019t held back by human PR weaknesses \u2014 like needing to stop working to eat or sleep.Pew says its analysis also suggests that\u00a0certain types of news and current events sites appear \u201cespecially likely\u201d to be tweeted by automated accounts. \u201cAmong the most prominent of these are aggregation sites, or sites that primarily compile content from other places around the web. An\u00a0estimated 89% of links to these aggregation sites over the study period were posted by bot accounts,\u201d they write.tl;dr: Bots appear to be less interested in promo-ing original reporting. Or, to put it another way, bot grunt work is often being deployed to try to milk cheap views out of other people\u2019s content.Another interesting observation: \u201cAutomated accounts also provide a somewhat higher-than-average proportion of links to sites lacking a public contact page or email address for contacting the editor or other staff.\u201cThe vast majority (90%) of the popular news and current events sites examined in this study had a public-facing, non-Twitter contact page. The small minority of sites lacking this type of contact page were shared by suspected bots at greater rates than those with contact pages. Some 75% of links to such sites were shared by suspected bot accounts during the period under study, compared with 60% for sites with a contact page.\u201dWithout reading too much into that finding, it\u2019s possible to theorize that sites without any public content page or email might be more likely to be hosting disinformation. (Pew\u2019s researchers don\u2019t go as far as to join those dots exactly \u2014 but they do note:\u00a0\u201cThis type of contact information can be used to submit reader feedback that may serve as the basis of corrections or additional reporting.\u201d)That said, Pew also found political content to be of relatively lower interest to bots vs other types of news and current affairs content \u2014 at least judging by this snapshot of English-language tweets (taken last summer).\u201c[C]ertain types of news and current events sites receive a lower-than-average share of their Twitter links from automated accounts,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cMost notably, this analysis indicates that popular news and current events sites featuring political content have the lowest level of link traffic from bot accounts among the types of news and current events content the Center analyzed, holding other factors constant. Of all links to popular media sources prominently featuring politics or political content over the time period of the study, 57% are estimated to have originated from bot accounts.\u201dThe researchers also looked at political affiliation \u2014 to try to determine whether suspected bots skew left or right in terms of the content they\u2019re sharing.(To determine the ideological leaning of the content being linked to on Twitter Pew says they\u00a0used a statistical technique known as correspondence analysis \u2014 examining the\u00a0media link sharing behavior of publications\u2019 Twitter audience in order to score the content itself on an ideological spectrum ranging from \u201cvery liberal\u201d to \u201cmost conservative\u201d.)In fact they found automated accounts posting a greater share of content from\u00a0sites that have \u201cideologically mixed or centrist human audiences\u201d. At least where\u00a0popular news and current events sites \u201cwith an orientation toward political news and issues\u201d are concerned.\u201cThe Center\u2019s analysis finds that suspected autonomous accounts post a higher proportion of links to sites that are primarily shared by human users who score near the center of the ideological spectrum, rather than those shared more often by either a more liberal or a more conservative audience,\u201d they write. \u201cAutomated accounts share roughly 57% to 66% of the links to political sites that are shared by an ideologically mixed or centrist human audience, according to the analysis.\u201dPew adds that right-left differences in the proportion of bot traffic were \u201cnot substantial\u201d.Although, on this, it\u2019s worth emphasizing that this portion of the analysis is based on a pretty small sub-set of an already exclusively English-language and US-focused snapshot of the Twittersphere. So reading too much into this portion of the analysis seems unwise.Pew notes: \u201cThis analysis is based on a subgroup of popular news and current events outlets that feature political stories in their headlines or have a politics section, and that serve a primarily U.S. audience. A total of 358 websites out of our full sample of 2,315 popular sites met these criteria.\u201dReally the study underlines a core truth about Twitter bots: They\u2019re often used for spam/PR purposes \u2014 to try to drive traffic to other websites. The substance of what they\u2019re promoting varies, though it can clearly often be adult content.Bots are also often used to try to cheaply drive clicks to a cheap content aggregator or product sites so that external entities can cheaply cash in thanks to boosted ad views and revenue.Political disinformation campaigns may well result in a lower volume of bot-generated spam/PR than porn or content farms. Though the potential damage \u2014 to democratic processes and societal institutions \u2014 is arguably way more serious. As well as being very difficult to quantify.And, well, where the influence of bots is concerned, we still have many more questions than answers.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/bots-on-twitter-share-two-thirds-of-links-to-popular-websites-pew/"},

{"title": ["Google launches an improved speech-to-text service for developers"], "text": "Only a few weeks after launching a major overhaul of its Cloud Text-to-Speech API, Google  today also announced an update to that service\u2019s Speech-to-Text voice recognition service. The new and improved Cloud Speech-to-Text API promises significantly improved voice recognition performance. The new API promises a reduction in word errors around 54 percent across all of Google\u2019s tests, but in some areas the results are actually far better than that.Part of this improvement is a major new feature in the Speech-to-Text API that now allows developers to select between different machine learning models based on this use case. The new API currently offers four of these models. There is one for short queries and voice commands, for example, as well as one for understanding audio from phone calls and another one for handling audio from videos. The fourth model is the new default, which Google recommends for all other scenarios.In addition to these new speech recognition models, Google is also updating the service with a new punctuation model. As the Google team admits, its transcriptions have long suffered from rather unorthodox punctuation. Punctuating transcribed speech is notoriously hard though (just ask anybody who has ever tried to transcribe a speech by the current U.S. president\u2026). Google promises that its new model results in far more readable transcriptions that feature fewer run-on sentences and more commas, periods and question marks.With this update, Google now also lets developers tag their transcribed audio or video with some basic metadata. There is no immediate benefit to the developer here, but Google says that it will use the aggregate information from all of its users to decide on which new features to prioritize next.Google is making a small change to how it charges for this service. Like before, audio transcripts cost $0.006 per 15 seconds.

{"title": ["App downloads and revenue again broke records in the first quarter of 2018"], "text": "Global app downloads and consumer spending in apps had yet another record quarter, according to a new report from App Annie, out on Monday. In the first quarter of 2018, iOS and Google Play downloads grew more than 10 percent year-over-year to reach 27.5 billion \u2013 the highest figure to date. In addition, consumer spending on iOS and Google Play grew 22 percent year-over-year to reach $18.4 billion \u2013 also a record number.The download figure is especially notable because App Annie  is not counting app updates or re-installs. That means someone re-downloading an app on a new\u00a0phone \u2013 like one received as a gift over the holidays \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have been counted here. Only new app installs were counted.Plus, the report points out that the total dollar amount to the app economy is much higher than the $18.4 billion reported for Q1, as App Annie only takes into account paid apps, in-app purchases, and subscriptions. It\u2019s not measuring things like in-app advertising, the commerce taking place in apps (e.g. shopping and ride-sharing), or the money being made on the third-party Android app stores around the world.This is not the first time App Annie has reported record numbers for downloads and consumer spending. The app marketplaces have continued to see steady growth, even as reports of app saturation\u00a0in the U.S. circulate.In Q4 2017 \u2013 the busy holiday quarter \u2013 the app stores had also broken these same records around downloads and revenues. Specifically, Google Play saw its highest downloads to date\u00a0in the fourth quarter. The app stores had a record-breaking Q3 2017, too \u2013 something App Annie attributed then to the growth of the app market in China, India, and other Southeast Asian nations.This time, App Annie pointed to India, Indonesia and Brazil\u2019s impact on the year-over-year growth in Google Play downloads, and the U.S., Russia and Turkey\u2019s impact on the growth of iOS downloads.Also notable is that Google Play achieved another record of its own in Q1 2018, with record growth in consumer spend thanks to the U.S, followed by Japan and the Philippines. The Play Store grew 25 percent year-over-year, versus iOS\u2019s 20 percent growth. Despite this, iOS continued to have a large lead in terms of total dollars spent.Music & Audio along with Entertainment apps had a big impact on Google Play spending, the report noted, both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis. This is attributed to the rise in music and video subscription services delivered via apps. App Annie isn\u2019t the only one to spot this trend \u2013 app store intelligence firm Sensor Tower had previously found that top subscription video on demand apps grew by 77 percent in 2017, reaching $781 million in revenues across iOS and Google Play. And Netflix became 2017\u2019s top non-game app by revenue.App Annie said also that iOS spending in Q1 2018 benefitted from subscriptions to health and fitness apps, driven by New Year\u2019s Resolutions and people\u2019s embrace of the subscription model. The U.S., followed by the U.K. then Germany saw the largest market share growth quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.Combined, Google Play and the iOS App Store offered 6.2 million apps by the end of Q1 2018, with games driving downloads across both stores during the quarter.\u00a0PUBG Mobile  and Fortnite were especially big, App Annie noted.Shopping apps also saw large year-over-year growth in market share, the report found.More broadly, the new report is yet another example of how big a role emerging markets are having on app downloads and the app economy. This trend, while still remarkable, is not all that new. In 2016, China overtook the U.S. in App Store revenue, and App Annie has continued to note China, India and other emerging markets as key drivers of growth\u00a0in its quarterly and annual reports.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-09 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/09/app-downloads-and-revenue-again-broke-records-in-the-first-quarter-of-2018/"},

In both cases, you\u2019ll have to capture the photo or video outside the Messenger app, the company notes.The update follows another that rolled out last fall,\u00a0allowing users to share high-resolution photos through Messenger \u2013 something that Facebook said was the result of its significant investments in helping people \u201ccommunicate visually.\u201dThe idea that mobile messaging is often a camera-first experience isn\u2019t unique to Facebook  Messenger, of course \u2013 it\u2019s the premise of the Snapchat experience and, these days, Instagram too.Unfortunately for Facebook, news of improved media-sharing capabilities comes at a time when the company is under siege for its mishandling of user data, and, most recently, another reveal that it had been retaining videos that users believed to be deleted. The broader effect of this news cycle around Facebook\u2019s approach to privacy, is an increased general mistrust of Facebook\u2019s products as the place to share \u2013 including sharing through Messenger, which isn\u2019t as distanced from the core product as Facebook-owned Instagram and Whatsapp are.Facebook says if you want to share a 360-degree photo, you\u2019ll need to first snap it with your camera or another 360-photo app before uploading it to Messenger where it will then be converted to an immersive experience that can be navigated through by the recipients via either tapping and dragging on mobile, or clicking and dragging on Messenger.com.Similarly, HD videos will need to be first captured from the phone, or re-shared from the Facebook Newsfeed or other messages.The rollout of the HD feature is limited to select markets for now, including\u00a0Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S. on iOS and Android.360 photos, however, are available worldwide on iOS and Android.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/messenger-adds-support-for-sharing-hd-video-360-degree-photos/"},

With B2, however, the company also launched a file-centric cloud storage service for developers in 2015 that aims to challenge similar offerings from AWS and Azure on price.Because Backblaze  doesn\u2019t offer any other cloud computing services, that was always a bit of a hard sell, as developers had to work with multiple vendors to write their apps and pay for the data transfer between B2 and their compute providers. But Backblaze is sweetening the deal today with a partnership with Packet and ServerCentral that will allow for free data transfer.This matchup makes a lot of sense for the three independent cloud providers involved. Packet is mostly known for its bare-metal server offerings, while ServerCentral focuses on helping businesses manage their IT infrastructure. Packet offers a block storage service, too, but the use case for that is somewhat different from Backblaze\u2019s storage service.\u201cWith over a decade of building the lowest-cost cloud storage, we\u2019re proud to be able to profitably offer customers storage at one-fourth of the price of S3,\u201d noted Gleb Budman, CEO of Backblaze. \u201cOur partnerships with Packet and ServerCentral now enable us to jointly support a variety of new uses and customers. Both providers offer world class compute offerings. And, by charging $0.00 for transfers between Backblaze and our Compute Partners, customers choose what\u2019s best for their particular workload.\u201dLikewise, Packet and ServerCentral argue that their services allow developers to use their services and save on their AWS bill.\u201cMany cloud users realize too late that traditional vendor pricing schemes are meant to lock in customer data. In our industry, it\u2019s known as data gravity and Dropbox just saved $74 million by avoiding it with their move off of AWS,\u201d said Jacob Smith, co-founder of Packet. \u201cThe question we had was \u2018how can we democratize that Dropbox effect?\u2019 The answer was clear \u2013 directly connecting with Backblaze\u2019s B2 Cloud Storage offering.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/backblaze-partners-with-packet-and-server-central-to-better-challenge-the-big-clouds/"},

That way you could click a few buttons to do a very specific search for something like \u201cFamily\u201d movies rated \u201cPG\u201d or \u201cG\u201d at Cobb or AMC theaters in the afternoon on Sunday, for example.

{"title": ["Bancor takes on Crypto exchanges with wallet that converts across tokens"], "text": "With the number of cryptocurrencies passing 1,000, and the craze continuing, things are getting pretty wild out there to say the least. And these crypto asssets can vary from the tokens issued by some no-name startup all the way up to Ether and the venerable Bitcoin. The trouble is, converting those coins into other currencies which you might actually use, or perhaps into the more fiat-friendly Bitcoin and Ether, has been hard. Users have to use exchanges to convert their cryptocurrencies via exchanges where prices can fluctuate wildly. Since cryptocurrency is the main \u201capplication\u201d for blockchain technologies right now, that would mean wallets where they are held effectively becoming a new type of \u2018browser\u2019.This is the thinking behind the launch today of Bancor\u2019s wallet. Bancor was already an open-source protocol for automated token conversions, and had raised approximately $153 million in ICO last year. Its new wallet will offer built-in conversion between 75 cryptocurrencies, with more being added each day. This means users will not need to send their cryptocurrencies to exchanges if they wish to acquire other forms of crypto-assets and can instead convert cryptocurrencies directly inside the Bancor Wallet. The wallet is not a native smartphone app, but is optimised for mobile use.Problems at the major crypto exchanges have been mounting, putting many off joining the crypto world. So it\u2019s likely that many Crypto holders will be tempted by the relative stability of in-wallet conversion, even if they can\u2019t play the arbitrage game so easily.Instead of converting the currencies by matching buyers and sellers as an exchange does, Bancor\u2019s in-wallet conversions are made against smart contracts. In theory, this gives users transparent and efficient pricing without the spreads and fees associated with exchanges. Users are always in control of their keys and Bancor neither holds nor has access to users funds.In addition, the Bancor Wallet allows users to purchase tokens with any major credit or debit card and instantly convert them to any token in the Bancor Network, including heavily-traded coins like Ether and EOS.Galia Benartzi, co-founder of Bancor said in statement: \u201cIn the new Internet of value, where anyone can create a currency, digital wallets are becoming the browsers which allow users to navigate the emerging world of decentralized apps. To be useful, users need seamless and secure interfaces to blockchain-based products as well as on-demand conversion between the tokens that power them.\u201cMoney is changing, and digital wallets must be as dynamic as the currencies they hold. Imagine if your coffee shop loyalty points were accepted at any cash register in the world, or your airline miles could buy cellular minutes with the click of a button\u2026 Bancor\u2019s new wallet aims to deliver on that promise by offering continuous access to crypto tokens and instant convertibility between virtual assets, unlocking enormous purchasing power for consumers,\u201d she added.Bancor Wallet users can open accounts using an email address, Telegram, WeChat, or Facebook Messenger.The Bancor Wallet will only likely to get uptake if it can continue to add integration with tokens and maintain a live status and instant conversions.

{"title": ["Stackery lands $5.5 million for serverless platform"], "text": "When Stackery\u2019s founders were still at New Relic\u00a0in 2014, they recognized there was an opportunity to provide instrumentation for the emerging serverless tech market. They left the company after New Relic\u2019s IPO and founded Stackery with the goal of providing a governance and management layer for serverless architecture.The company had a couple of big announcements today starting with their $5.5 million round, which they are calling a \u201cseed plus\u201d \u2014 and a new tool for tracking serverless performance called the Health Metrics Dashboard.Let\u2019s start with the funding round. Why the Seed Plus designation? Company co-founder and CEO Nathan Taggart says they could have done an A round, but the designation was a reflection of the reality of where their potential market is today. \u201cFrom our perspective, there was an appetite for an A, but the Seed Plus represents the current stage of the market,\u201d he said. That stage is still emerging as companies begin to see the benefits of the serverless approach.HWVP led the round. Voyager Capital, Pipeline Capital Partners, and Founders\u2019 Co-op also participated. Today\u2019s investment brings the total raised to $7.3 million since the company was founded in 2016.Serverless computing like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions is a bit of a misnomer. There is a server underlying the program, but instead of maintaining a dedicated server for your particular application, you only pay when there is a trigger event. Like cloud computing that came before, developers love it because it saves them a ton of time configuring (or begging) for resources for their applications.But as with traditional cloud computing \u2014 serverless is actually a cloud service \u2014 developers can easily access it. If you think back to the Consumerization of IT phenomenon that began around 2011, it was this ability to procure cloud services so easily that resulted in a loss of control inside organizations.As back then, companies want the advantages of serverless technology, but they also want to know how much they are paying, who\u2019s using it and that it\u2019s secure and in compliance with all the rules of the organization. That\u2019s where Stackery  comes in.As for the new Health Metrics Dashboard, that\u2019s an extension of this vision, one that fits in quite well with the monitoring roots of the founders. Serverless often involves containers, which can encompass many functions. When something goes wrong it\u2019s hard to trace what the root cause was.\u201cWe are showing architecture-wide throughput and performance at each resource point and [developers] can figure out where there are bottlenecks, performance problems or failure.The company launched in 2016.

{"title": ["Adobe brings more of its AI smarts to its video tools"], "text": "Right in time for NAB, Adobe today announced the latest updates to its Premiere CC and After Effects CC video editing and motion graphics tools. The general theme of this release is the introduction of two new AI-powered tools that will make the life of editors easier, as well as a variety of small updates that all result in an improved overall workflow.\u201cThe demands and pace of video content creation are reaching levels we\u2019ve never seen before. The time pressure on video professionals means the need for powerful and efficient creative tools has never been greater,\u201d said Steven Warner, vice president of digital video and audio at Adobe . \u201cAdobe video apps like Premiere Pro and After Effects give them that power which, combined with the services available in Creative Cloud, provides broadcasters, media companies, filmmakers and YouTubers a complete ecosystem to bring their stories to screen faster than ever.\u201dThe standout feature of this release is the new Color Match feature in Premiere Pro CC. When you shoot with multiple cameras \u2014 and especially cameras from different brands \u2014 the colors between shots usually don\u2019t match. It\u2019s then the editor\u2019s job to make everything look right, which can be a rather tedious job. Now, Adobe is using its Sensei AI platform to help editors match colors automatically, so that the changes they need to make are pretty small.The company is also bringing face detection to Premiere Pro, which will make it easier to adjust skin tones between shots.The second new AI-driven feature is an improved audio autoducking feature that also leverages Sensei. The system intelligently reduces the volume of the music or effects soundtrack around dialog, though editors can always manually override any of these changes.Unsurprisingly, this release also includes plenty of other updates. Adobe is launching a deeper integration with Adobe Stock, for example, to give its users direct access to the footage and Motion Graphics templates available in the service. Those Motion Graphics, which allow you to mix animations or graphics and videos for title sequences or callouts inside a video, are also getting an update with new controls for positioning them, among other things. Editors who are experimenting with storytelling in VR now get an improved version of the Adobe Immersive Environment to allow them to edit right in VR. And with this update, these editors can now also use a Windows Mixed Reality headset to edit.The highlight of the new release of After Effects CC is probably the enhanced Puppet Engine. This feature now makes it easier to create organic-looking and realistic effects when you have layers like a fluttering flag or ripples on water.Editors who need to build data-driven animations can now also import JSON and CSV files to create graphics and timelines.Adobe Character Animator CC, the tool behind shows like \u201cOur Cartoon President,\u201d is also getting a refresh with improvements across the board. These include the inclusion of new puppet templates to help you get started, improved particle physics to add dynamic elements like snowfall or collapsing brick walls to your animations, and overall improvements to how the puppets behave when you animate them.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/adobe-brings-more-of-its-ai-smarts-to-its-video-tools/"},
{"title": ["HTC is looking for a savior in VR, but it won\u2019t find it"], "text": "Times are certainly tight at HTC,  but their plays in the consumer VR market are starting to look like Hail Marys.The company\u2019s central VR platform play, their Viveport subscription product, is regarded by a lot of people I\u2019ve talked to as little more than bloatware, while their newest product, the Vive Pro, is an impressive piece of tech with a price tag that serves as a middle finger to the company\u2019s fans.Today, HTC announced\u00a0it would be bundling previous-generation controllers and sensors with the Vive Pro for an additional $299, bringing the all-in price for consumers to a mind-boggling $1,098 for a system that\u2019s only mildly better than its competitors.HTC had a sort of first-to-market advantage with the Vive, but it\u2019s playing in a space where the potential victors are eyeing the spoils with telescopes. Competing in the U.S. with Google and Facebook and Microsoft is a startling task, but companies that have succeeded have been able to do so because they are incredibly nimble. HTC is a clear underdog, but as more pressure has been put on its VR arm to save the company and deliver meaningful returns now, it\u2019s clear that it doesn\u2019t have enough to offer.The company is fresh off another awful quarterly earnings report, where it made it clear that it was driving some strategy changes in its VR and smartphone businesses.The company sold a chunk of its smartphone business to Google for $1.1 billion earlier this year and the company said it plans to pump that money back into \u201cgreater investment in emerging technologies.\u201dThe Taiwanese company certainly has had a tough challenge competing with a deep-pocketed foe like Facebook, which really has no interest in hardware margins and has already invested and pledged funds into its VR ambitions that equal HTC\u2019s market cap several times over.HTC\u2019s recent moves seem to be aiming more toward a market Facebook wouldn\u2019t serve, which in this case is the super high-end. The thing is, the Vive Pro isn\u2019t even that high-end; the screen resolution bump is already available on the $499 Samsung Odyssey. The Vive Pro is probably the best VR headset available now, but given the competition, it\u2019s a premium I\u2019d maybe pay $599 for, especially noting how much better the Oculus Touch controllers are compared to the dated Vive wands.Here\u2019s the field at the moment (high-end PC costs not included):If HTC wanted to sell this as a tool for professionals, that would have been fine, but\u00a0HTC had already built a more expensive \u201centerprise edition\u201d of the Vive. They should have done the same here, bundled it with SteamVR 2.0 tracking and sold it at an exorbitant price marketed solely toward enterprise customers who could use the giant tracking area afforded by Valve\u2019s new tech advances. Then they could\u2019ve sold this Vive Pro \u201cconsumer edition\u201d at an all-in price that was still too expensive at like $799 with a lower headset-only price. If they can\u2019t afford to do that, then they clearly are aiming to sell this thing to more consumers than reality will allow.The one thing holding most consumers to the Vive isn\u2019t the HTC hardware or the company\u2019s Viveport subscription \u2014 it\u2019s Valve\u2019s SteamVR tech, which is the gold standard in high-end VR for accurately determining the position of the headset and controllers. It\u2019s only one piece of the puzzle, but for VR enthusiasts it\u2019s the Vive\u2019s secret sauce. That\u2019s not great for HTC, which does not have an exclusive relationship with Valve. It\u2019s left the company looking to distance themselves from Valve with their Viveport store, which seems like an incredibly difficult sell to both consumers and developers right now.The company isn\u2019t just looking at PC VR, though. The company also released a Vive Focus standalone headset to the Chinese market. But after canning its plans to release the headset on Daydream in the U.S., it seems that HTC is chasing markets outside China after all. That move offers some separation between HTC and Valve, but would leave them fending for themselves on mobile hardware that has a wirelessly tracked headset but no tracked controllers. Facebook is likely releasing its non-tracked Oculus Go headset in the next few months for $199, while it has already begun getting tracked \u201cSanta Cruz\u201d headset dev kits out.It\u2019s hard enough to succeed in the VR market when you\u2019re not worried about making money, and that\u2019s not exactly a recipe to thrive for a company trying to find the road to recovery. The company\u2019s latest efforts show that it wants to speed up the timelines for its VR business to begin earning back its investment, but I suspect that in the fragile market, it will only serve to alienate its core consumers. HTC wants \u201cemerging tech\u201d to lead it out of the gutter, but virtual reality is too much of a long-game technology for a company that is in desperate need of some short-term answers.Update: Corrected Acer headset MSRP to $399, though it is available for $245 on Amazon currently.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/htc-is-looking-for-a-savior-in-vr-but-it-wont-find-it/"},

This is halfway through the trading day, and a record for the latest opening time for a public debut.Shortly after the open, shares fell to a little above $160.The digital music company isn\u2019t selling its shares on the stock market, meaning the company isn\u2019t raising any money today. Instead, the event known as a \u201cdirect listing,\u201d is a collection of\u00a0transactions from existing shareholders (like employees and investors) selling shares directly to stock market investors. It took a while for the market makers to sort this out.For more on how Spotify could earn enough to thrive as a public company, read our feature piece:Spotify is basically trying to recreate the secondary market activity that happened before it went public.\u00a0 The company says that in 2018, shares traded on the private markets between $90 and $132.50.\u00a0Since Spotify didn\u2019t do an IPO, it set a \u201creference price\u201d of $132 per share, which would have given the company a valuation of $23.5 billion.Unlike a traditional IPO where employees don\u2019t sell shares for months, known as a \u201clock-up,\u201d Spotify insiders are already allowed to sell.If few people opt to sell, it will drive share prices up, because of limited supply. If a lot of insiders\u00a0sell, the reverse could happen, if investor demand doesn\u2019t meet it. This may lead to increased volatility in the first few days or weeks of trading.In the long-run, Spotify\u2019s performance in the stock market will largely depend on its business performance and outlook.Some investors are concerned that Spotify will run the course of competitor Pandora, which has struggled as a public company, partly due to hefty artist fees. Others argue that Spotify could be viewed as a Netflix, which has been successful in\u00a0entertainment licensing agreements.It\u2019s certainly a big and growing business. The company says it is present in 61 countries and its platform includes 159 million monthly active users and 71 million premium subscribers.Spotify had 4.09 billion Euros in revenue last year (or close to $5 billion), compared to 2.95 billion Euros (about $3.6 billion) the year before. 2015 saw 1.94 billion Euros in revenue (about $2.38 billion).Losses for last year were 1.2 billion Euros ($1.47 billion), which compares to 539 million Euros ($661 million) the year before.Spotify previously raised about $2.7 billion in both debt and equity financing.\u00a0Tencent, Tiger Global, Sony Music and Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV) are amongst its largest shareholders.CEO and co-founder Daniel Ek has voting power that represents 23.8% of the company.

The company announced it has crossed the $.5 billion annual run rate since its last earning report in February. It also announced a new enterprise content management product specifically geared for large customer service organizations.The company was just shy of the goal after its most recent earnings report\u00a0(pdf) with $123.4 million for the quarter. They say they have since passed that goal, but have not announced it until now, based on revenue that closed March 31, 2018. The company is projecting between $555 and $565 million in revenue for fiscal 2018, according to its last earnings report. When you consider that when the company went public in 2014, it was at $100 million in annual revenue, reaching a half billion dollars in 4 years is significant.Zendesk  reports that 40 percent of its revenue now comes from larger enterprise customers, which they define as 100 seats or more. The company is predicting it will cross the $1 billion run rate by some time in 2020.\u201cWhen we IPOed, our run rate was $100 million.

The idea is to empower customer service reps to write up solutions to problems they encounter and build up that knowledge base as part of the natural act of doing their jobs.That gives organizations a couple of advantages. First of all, the reps can find their fellow employees\u2019 notes and not have to reinvent the wheel every time, and the notes and articles they write can pass through editorial review and become part of the permanent knowledge base.When customers hit the site or app, they can access solutions to common problems before having to talk to a human. The platform also includes reminders to check the content regularly so the knowledge base stays fresh and stale content is removed.Finally, the company is applying AI to the problem. The artificial intelligence component can review the corpus of information currently available in the entire knowledge base and identify gaps in content that the company might want to add, allowing for proactive content creation.The content management idea isn\u2019t new to Zendesk. McDermott says they shipped the first content management product years ago, but what\u2019s different is that this is geared to larger organizations and that the AI piece allows for some automation of this process. \u201cThe new workflow brings rich AI concepts like content analytics into the publishing flow,\u201d he said.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/zendesk-hits-500-m-run-rate-launches-customer-service-content-management-platform/"},
{"title": ["Facebook launches bulk app removal tool amidst privacy scandal"], "text": "Following the Cambridge Analytica  scandal, users have flocked to their Facebook  privacy settings to sever their connection to third-party apps that they no longer wanted to have access to their data. But deleting them all took forever because you had to remove them one by one. Now Facebook has released a new way to select as many apps as you want, then remove them in bulk. The feature has rolled out on mobile and desktop, and Facebook also offers the option to delete any posts those apps have made to your profile.Facebook confirmed the launch to TechCrunch, pointing to its Newsroom and Developer News blog posts from the last few weeks that explained that \u201cWe already show people what apps their accounts are connected to and control what data they\u2019ve permitted those apps to use. In the coming month, we\u2019re going to make these choices more prominent and easier to manage.\u201d Now we know what \u201ceasier\u201d looks like. A Facebook spokesperson told us \u201cwe have more to do and will be sharing more when we can.\u201d\u00a0The updated interface was first spotted by Matt Navarra, who had previously called on Facebook to build a bulk removal option.Facebook stopped short of offering a \u201cselect all\u201d button so you have to tap each individually. That could prevent more innocent, respectful developers from getting caught up in the dragnet as users panic to prune their app connections.

This charming little top-down adventure combines some clever puzzle solving with a well-realized black and white art style.The pitch is simple: You\u2019re a little guy who picks up a cursed sword that causes you to die every 60 seconds and start over from your home. So whatever you do in this game, you have to do in less than a minute.Some things reset when you die, and some things stay done \u2014 enemies will return, but favors will be remembered, keys retained and so on. Figuring out how to effect lasting progress is a big part of the fun.Also fun is the art style, which is determinedly monochromatic; not even a shade of grey to be found, only the kind of patterning and hatching I remember from my Mac Classic days. But the developers, a motley crew assembled from a variety of teams, use the simplicity to create a wealth of personality. The limited writing is also fun, with characters barking everything from subtle hints to total non sequiturs.The simplicity of the graphics and controls (there are just the directions, a button to use your item and a button to die early so as not to have to wait) don\u2019t mean pushover gameplay, though. You\u2019ll have to be very observant and explore every nook and cranny to be sure you have what you need to proceed. I was stuck near the end of the game because I didn\u2019t explore literally every corner of one particularly dark area.It isn\u2019t boring pixel-peeping \u2014 I\u2019m just saying you need to keep your eyes peeled, because everything is where it is for good reason.I finished my first run (there\u2019s a New Game+ mode) in a bit under two hours, but there was definitely a lot of stuff I didn\u2019t find and side quests I didn\u2019t pursue to their ends. I kept surprising myself with locations I thought I\u2019d explored completely, but rushed to the end so I could write this extremely detailed review.Minit is a bargain at $10 \u2014 you can pick it up for PC, PS4 or Xbox One.

The world\u2019s most impactful tech startup conference is about to get bigger and better than ever.We\u2019re moving to Moscone West, doubling attendance capacity, and tripling our programming with a total of four stages across three days. Which means we need the greatest minds in the biz to grace our stage.That said, I\u2019m pleased to announce that 23andMe\u2019s Anne Wojcicki and Unity\u2019s John Riccitiello will be joining us on stage!After a decade investing in healthcare, Anne Wojcicki co-founded 23andMe  in 2006. The company launched with a primary focus of giving consumers access to their own genetic information, disrupting an industry that Ancestry.com (founded in 1983) had been dominating.But it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for the company. In 2013, the FDA started to intervene with 23andMe after growing concerned that the company might be giving consumers possibly inaccurate information about their genetic health risk. This led to the FDA halting the marketing and sale of 23andMe\u2019s personal genome service.Regulatory approval, especially from the FDA, is a nightmare for many startups just getting their footing. But Wojcicki made the best of a tough situation and pivoted the company towards drug research and development, while simultaneously working on FDA approval.Later that year, the company got the green-light to offer 10 carrier tests, including one for Parkinson\u2019s and one for late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s.Since then, the company has partnered with Pfizer to help with drug research using 23andMe\u2019s genetic data, introduced a therapeutics division, and hired top talent including Genentech\u2019s Richard Sheller.In 2017, 23andMe raised $250 million led by Sequoia, bringing total funding to $491 million to date. At the time, Wojcicki said that they had only begun to scratch the surface of direct-to-consumer genetics. The company also recently got approval for a new cancer risk test, becoming the first and only direct-to-consumer genetics company to receive FDA authorization to test for cancer risk without a prescription.There\u2019s more than plenty to discuss with Wojcicki when we get her on stage at Disrupt SF September 5 \u2013 September 7 and we\u2019re thrilled to have her as a guest!At one point, a gaming engine was just that. A gaming engine. But today\u2019s landscape, complete with a plethora of mobile, console and desktop games as well as the rise of AR/VR puts a gaming engine square in the middle of a brave new world.John Riccitiello\u2019s Unity,  a company whose software provides the backbone for more than half of all new mobile games, is poised to be one of the most important technology companies of the next decade, according to DFJ Growth partner Barry Schuler, an investor at the company.As of mid-2017, Unity\u2019s engine powered more than two-thirds of all content created for AR and VR. Ninety-one percent of applications on emerging AR platforms like the Microsoft HoloLens are created on the engine, while Samsung\u2019s Gear VR has about 90 percent of its gaming titles built using Unity.Alongside the growth of gaming, Unity\u2019s ability to provide infrastructure for spatial computing puts Unity in a position to see other industries line up at its doorstep, from fashion to arts to the enterprise. As these spaces continue to heat up, Unity will be at the center of it all.With nearly $700 million raised, Riccitiello was pretty quiet when asked about the potential of Unity going public as of May 2017. Hopefully, the former EA COO will have more to share on that front on the Disrupt SF stage. But in the case he doesn\u2019t, we have plenty of questions about the future of Unity.Disrupt SF 2017 runs from September 5 to September 7 at Moscone West.

{"title": ["Facebook fights fake news with author info, rolls out publisher context"], "text": "Red flags and \u201cdisputed\u201d tags just entrenched people\u2019s views about suspicious news articles, so Facebook  is hoping to give readers a wide array of info so they can make their own decisions about what\u2019s misinformation. Facebook will try showing links to a journalist\u2019s Wikipedia entry, other articles, and a follow button to help users make up their mind about whether they\u2019re a legitimate source of news. The test will show up to a subset of users in the U.S. when users click on the author\u2019s name within an Instant Article if the author\u2019s publisher has implemented Facebook\u2019s author tags.Meanwhile, Facebook is rolling out to everyone in the U.S. its test from October that gives readers more context about publications by showing links to their Wikipedia pages, related articles about the same topic, how many times the article has been shared and where, and a button for following the publisher within an \u201cAbout This Article\u201d button. Facebook will also start to show whether friends have shared the article, and a a snapshot of the publisher\u2019s other recent articles.Since much of this context can be algorithmically generated rather than relying on human fact checkers, the system could scale much more quickly to different languages and locations around the world.These moves are designed to feel politically neutral to prevent Facebook from being accused of bias. After former contractors reported that they suppressed conservative Trending topics on Facebook in 2016, Facebook took a lot of heat for supposed liberal bias. That caused it to hesitate when fighting fake news before the 2016 Presidential election\u2026and then spend the next two years dealing with the backlash for allowing misinformation to run rampant.Facebook\u2019s partnerships with outside fact checkers that saw red Disputed flags added to debunked articles actually backfired. Those sympathetic to the false narrative saw the red flag as a badge of honor, clicking and sharing any way rather than allowing someone else to tell them they\u2019re wrong.That\u2019s why today\u2019s rollout and new test never confront users directly about whether an article, publisher, or author is propagating fake news. Instead Facebook hopes to build a wall of evidence as to whether a source is reputable or not.If other publications have similar posts, the publisher or author have well-established Wikipedia articles to back up their integrity, and if the publisher\u2019s other articles look legit, users could draw their own conclusion that they\u2019re worth beleiving. But if there\u2019s no Wikipedia links, other publications are contradicting them, no friends have shared it, and a publisher or author\u2019s other articles look questionable too, Facebook might be able to incept the idea that the reader should be skeptical.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/facebook-author-info/"},

The experience is part of a new, free iOS app called Yakables, which Conversive plans to expand with more talking animals.Pomeroy said she first met with Conversive  CEO Kevin Cornish for a general discussion about how IMAX might incorporate AR, but it just so happened that he showed off his platform using a talking panda \u2014 \u00a0so a collaboration around Pandas seemed obvious. She described the work of Conversive and Cornish\u2019s agency Moth + Flame as \u201cmiraculous,\u201d particularly since they had to work on \u201ca very quick timeframe\u201d to get the app ready for the documentary\u2019s release.In fact, Cornish said that writing the script and finding the right voice actor ended up taking the most time, with the actual animation requiring only a day. That\u2019s because Conversive\u2019s technology can combine motion capture with the \u201cintent\u201d behind an actor\u2019s words to programmatically generate character animations.\u201cThe content can be generated really quickly, at a really low cost, so that having hours of conversational education is actually a realistic thing,\u201d Cornish said.He also argued that by placing the panda in a real-world environment, the interaction becomes more immersive: \u201cThe screen disappears and it becomes about you and this subject.\u201dAnd while this is just one project and one app, Pomeroy predicted that we\u2019ll see more AR from IMAX in the future.\u201cThis particular app in support of the documentary Pandas is a great test for us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fully anticipate this will be the first of many.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/imax-pandas-ar/"},
{"title": ["betaworks VisionCamp introduces seven new AR/computer vision companies"], "text": "More than ten years ago, betaworks  launched to foster an ecosystem of startups focused on the intersection of media and consumer behavior. While the mission hasn\u2019t changed, the structure has seen some tweaks. The company has introduced its own venture arm, led by Matt Hartman, as well as the more recent launch of betaworks Studios.But nestled gently between the two are betaworks Camps program. Camps are a sort of hyper-specific accelerator program, within which a small cohort of early-stage startups build out their products within a certain theme, complete with the full resources of betaworks (marketing, legal, space, etc.) as well as a small investment.Camps first launched with BotCamp, followed shortly by VoiceCamp, and today the graduates of VisionCamp  are showing off their wares for the first time at Demo Day.Camera IQ calls itself a camera experience manager. The company works with brands and publishers to develop virtual worlds for customers, with partners including Spotify, Neiman Marcus and Viacom. The technology integrates AR toolkits and mobile OSes with brands native apps to offer different experiences for consumers. Camera IQ was founded by Allison Wood and Sonia Tsao. The founders say that the camera represents the next great consumption experience, as well as the next great transaction experience. The company hopes to sit at that intersection.Livestreaming and FaceTime are now accessible to everyone, but not everyone wants to show their face on these platforms. Enter Facemoji. The startup offers 3D avatar webcams that streams your facial expressions via the avatar without ever showing your real likeness. The company was originally focused on gamers who stream on Twitch, with plans to expand to video chat. Facemoji was founded by Robin Raszka and Tom Krcha.Originally called Surreal, Leo offers a vast marketplace of AR objects, stamps and artwork so that users can change the world around them. Leo has raised $1.5 million in seed and has relationships with upwards of 2,000 artists on the platform. The company, which was founded by Dana Loberg and Sahin Boydas, makes money by sharing revenue with artists who create objects for the platform.Nearly half of land area in cities is made up of streets, sidewalks and parks, and cities have no data or insights on these spaces. Numina partners with cities to place computer vision sensors on light poles in these areas and offer anonymous flow data about pedestrians in these spaces. The company offers an API for streets, as well, to give developers access to real-time activity and a backlog of activity for their apps, whether it\u2019s for mobility, insurance, real estate, or logistics. Numina was founded by Tara Pham and Martin McGreal.Selerio brings together the real world and the virtual world by using computer vision to map the layout and objects in a room and replace them with a virtual world. Imagine putting old-school Victorian furniture inside an existing space. The company uses deep learning and computer vision in its technology, which was spun out of Cambridge University. Selerio offers an SDK to developers and is currently being integrated with Apple\u2019s ARKit. Selerio was founded by Ghislain Tasse and Flora Ponjou Tasse.Streem supports the professional home services industry by using computer vision, machine learning, and AR to capture vital information (like model, make and serial number) through a simply live video chat. Through Streem\u2019s technology, service pros can capture information, take measurements and save notes without ever stepping foot in the client\u2019s home, letting them offer quotes much faster and solve the problem in one try. Streem was founded by Ryan Fink and Sean Adkinson.Despite the fact that capturing and editing video is more accessible than ever, video editing remains a time-consuming and tedious process. The Trash TV app uses computer vision and AI to edit consumer videos into something beautiful and usable. The company uses a stock video repository that includes proof of creation to fill in the gaps. Trash TV was founded by Hannah Donovan and Anton Marini.This is the third of betaworks\u2019 Camps. The next one, according to Camps General Manager Danika Laszuk, is focused on the intersection of live streaming and participatory audiences. Dubbed LiveCamp, betaworks hopes to find startups evolving the space as Twitch streaming and apps like HQ continue to pull in large viewerships and the lines between performer and audience are blurred.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-03 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/03/betaworks-visioncamp-introduces-seven-new-ar-computer-vision-companies/"},

Juro is announcing Taavet Hinrikus  (TransferWise\u2019s co-founder) as an investor now too, as well as Michael Pennington (Gumtree co-founder) and the family office of Paul Forster (co-founder of\u00a0Indeed.com).Back in January 2017 the London-based startup closed a $750,000 (\u00a3615k) seed round, though\u00a0CEO and co-founder Richard Mabey tells us that was really better classed as an\u00a0angel round \u2014 with Point Nine Capital only joining \u201clate\u201d in the day.\u201cWe actually could have strung it out to Series A,\u201d he says of the funding that\u2019s being announced now. \u201cBut we had multiple offers come in and there is so much of an explosion in demand for the [machine learning] that it made sense to do a round now rather than wait for the A. The whole legal industry is undergoing radical change and we want to be leading it.\u201dJuro\u2019s SaaS  product\u00a0is an integrated contracts workflow that combines contract creation, e-signing and commenting capabilities with AI-powered contract analytics.Its general focus is on customers that have to manage a high volume of contacts \u2014 such as marketplaces.The 2016-founded startup is not breaking out any customer numbers yet but says its\u00a0client list includes the likes of Estee Lauder, Deliveroo and Nested. And\u00a0Mabey adds that \u201cmost\u201d of its\u00a0demand is coming from enterprise at this point, noting it has \u201cseveral tech unicorns and Fortune 500 companies in trial\u201d.While design is clearly a major focus \u2014 with the startup deploying clean-looking templates and visual cues to offer a user-friendly \u2018upgrade\u2019 on traditional legal processes \u2014 the machine learning component is its scalable, value-added differentiator to serve the target b2b users by helping them identify recurring sticking points in contract negotiations and keep on top of contract renewals.Mabey tells TechCrunch the new funding will be used to double down on development of the machine learning component of the product.\u201cWe\u2019re not the first to market in contract management by about 25 years,\u201d he says with a smilie. \u201cSo we have always needed to prove out our vision of why the incumbents are failing. One part of this is clunky UX and we\u2019ve succeeded so far in replacing legacy providers through better design (e.g. we replace DocuSign at 80% of our customers).\u201cBut the thing we and our investors are really excited about is not just helping businesses with contract workflow but helping them understand their contract data, auto-tag contracts, see pattens in negotiations and red flag unusual contract terms.\u201dWhile this machine learning element is where he sees Juro cutting out a competitive edge in an existing and established market, Mabey concedes it takes \u201cquite a lot of capital to do well\u201d. Hence taking more funding now.\u201cWe need a level of predictive accuracy in our models that risk averse lawyers can get comfortable with and that\u2019s a big ask!\u201d he says.Specifically, Juro will be using the funding to hire data scientists and machine learning engineers \u2014 building out the team at both its London and Riga offices. \u201cWe\u2019re doing it like crazy,\u201d adds Mabey. \u201cFor example, we just hired from the UK government Digital Service the data scientist who delivered the first ML model used by the UK government (on the gov.uk website).\u201cThere is a huge opportunity here but great execution is key and we\u2019re building a world class team to do it.

Gox collapsed into bankruptcy in 2014 following the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins and tens of millions of dollars, those who lost money were understandably furious.For a small group of people, however, the theft \u2014 likely masterminded, we now know, by a Russian cybercrime suspect who was arrested in Greece this past summer \u2014 would prove auspicious.Specifically, Michael Gronager, who was then COO of the Kraken bitcoin exchange, spied an opportunity to team up with a new friend, Jonathan Levin, a post-graduate economist from Oxford who\u2019d written academic works on crytpocurrencies. The two were already discussing intelligence software that could trace specific transactions on the blockchain and be sold to law enforcement. Before long, their young company, Chainalysis, was the official investigator on the Mt. Gox case, hired by its bankruptcy trustee to find all those missing coins.Its small team \u201ccracked the case probably two months in,\u201d Levin says now.It was a far bigger credit than most companies start off with, and Chainalysis  smartly ran with it, signing up customers like the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and Europol to help them catch criminals.But Chainalysis \u2014 which now employs 75 people and has offices in New York, Washington and Copenhagen \u2014 isn\u2019t interested in forensics alone. It also wants to work with the world\u2019s financial institutions\u00a0to help them detect fraud and prevent money laundering. How? Through a new product called\u00a0KYT \u2014 for Know Your Transaction \u2014 that Levin says provides real-time feedback on the underlying purpose of blockchain transactions and feeds into exchanges\u2019 transaction processing engines. Compliance personnel also can use Chainalysis\u2019s dashboard to generate alerts on risky customers and export suspicious activity reports.A small group of early customers has already been using the product, whose cost Levin declines to say publicly. Starting today, it says its opening up the product to any financial institution wanting to use it.In a nod to its law enforcement and government customers, Chainalysis is separately launching investigation tools around 10 more currencies in addition to Bitcoin, which it has traced from the start. The first of these is Bitcoin Cash, a fork of Bitcoin that was launched last summer following a longstanding disagreement in the crypto community about how to scale Bitcoin. The other cryptocurrencies are to be determined, says Levin, adding that as far as Chainalysis is concerned, \u201cThe different blockchains that power different cryptocurrencies are all part of the same machine.\u201dChainalysis has competitors, including Elliptic, a London-based rival that similarly runs investigations related to cryptocurrency and has raised $7 million in funding to date, including from the bank Banco Santander and Octopus Ventures.It may be harder than ever to catch Chainalysis, however, if it can live up to the claims it makes about its own efficacy. To wit,\u00a0in addition to announcing its new product for financial institutions and it those plans to support more cryptocurrencies, the company is today announcing it has landed $16 million in Series A funding from Benchmark,  one of the best venture firms in the business.The bet is going to mean something to industry watchers, given that Benchmark hasn\u2019t made a crypto-related investment in several years. Its only previous commitments, in fact, include a 2014\u00a0investment\u00a0in Pantera Capital, the hedge fund operator that buys and sells virtual currencies, and a 2014 investment in Xapo, the bitcoin wallet and storage company.That may well change with Benchmark\u2019s newest general partner, Sarah Tavel, who led the deal in Chainalysis and has joined its board. Tavel has been tracking the industry for several years, including as a VC at her prior firm, Greylock, and it\u2019s a \u201cspace I continue to spend time in,\u201d she tells us. \u201cThere will be some short-term noise and pain, but I long-term believe in it.\u201dAs for Benchmark\u2019s interest in Chainalysis in particular, Tavel suggested that it was a no brainer. It\u2019s a \u201cmeat and potatoes company,\u201d she says. \u201cAll these regulated institutions want to participate [in cryptocurrency transactions], but they need to understand with whom they are transacting and where their funds are originating. We\u2019d solved these traditional compliance requirements in the fiat world.\u201d With Benchmark\u2019s newest portfolio company, suggests Tavel, the cryptocurrency world may have its solution now, too.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/benchmark-just-funded-chainalysis-the-crypto-intelligence-company-that-helped-crack-the-mt-gox-case/"},

We have to assess if and how we can operate within this new framework and so will be suspending uberX in Athens from next Tuesday until we can find an appropriate solution.\u201dReuters reports that\u00a0the new rules in Greece include stipulations for ride-hailing companies including requiring that each trip start and end in the fleet partner\u2019s designated headquarters or parking area \u2014 something Uber does not do.The regulation also requires that a digital registry of all ride-sharing platforms and their passengers is created.Uber entered the Greek market back in 2015, and says\u00a0that around 450,000 rides have been booked in the market via its app \u2014 so it\u2019s clearly not a major market for the company.While Uber is suspending its UberX ride-hailing service in Athens (which uses licensed professional drivers working for a licensed fleet partner, per regulatory requirements), it says it will continue running its branded taxi service, UberTaxi (which only accepts licensed taxi drivers) \u2014 which does not face the same regulatory roadblocks.Taxi drivers in Athens staged an anti-Uber strike last month to protest the continued presence of non-professional drivers. Local press reports taxi unions have been pressing for laws to be passed to regulate ride-hailing rivals.Elsewhere in Europe, Uber has used a professional taxi service offering as a vehicle to return to some markets \u2014 reopening an offering in Barcelona last month, for example, after buying private hire vehicle licenses from a local operator.The Catalan capital remains an attractive market for ride-hailing operators as the host city for several tech conferences, including the world\u2019s largest mobile trade show which attracts 100k+ smartphone wielding visitors every year.However local taxi associations have also been robust in challenging the legality of the ride-hailing model in Spain. And continue to actively protest app players such as Uber and Cabify encroaching on the market.In other European markets Uber has withdrawn service entirely \u2014 such as Denmark, which it pulled out of a year ago, also blaming a new taxi law.It also ended UberX in Hungary back in 2016\u00a0\u2014 claiming government legislation made it impossible to operate there.While in London, UK \u2014 Uber\u2019s most important European market \u2014 the company\u2019s license to operate was withdrawn last September, though it can (and is) continuing to operate in the city during the appeals process.Transport for London cited safety concerns and anti-regulatory activity among its reasons for not renewing Uber\u2019s license.\u00a0The regulator also recently published a policy statement\u00a0setting out its priorities for updating regulations to take account of the fast-paced ride-hailing sector\u00a0\u2014 with safety also among its top stated priorities for shaping new rules.This report was corrected to specify that UberX in Greece was not a p2p service \u2014 but drivers must work for a licensed fleet partner", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/uberx-to-be-parked-in-greece-after-law-change/"},

Hoping to take a chunk of this nascent market, including competing with Google\u2019s own chatbot analytics product Chatbase, is Istanbul and San Francisco-based Botanalytics.Previously backed by 500 Startups, the company quietly raised $1 million in seed funding late last year. The round was led by ACT Venture Partners and will be used by Botanalytics  to further develop its technology.This will include enhancing support for \u201cvoice first\u201d platforms, and enabling business to gain actionable insights based on customer conversations, including understanding how to improve customer support across various channels. The idea is to be able to optimise voice and chatbot performance for engagement, retention and other KPIs.As it stands, Botanalytics supports a plethora of existing platforms including all of the big names: Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Messenger, Slack, Twitter, Telegram, Kik, Twilio, Skype, Line, Microsoft Teams, WeChat and Viber.The analytics offering spans a number of features, such as \u201cfundamental metrics\u201d measurement, segmenting conversations, tracking activities of a chatbot, retention of conversations, live take-over, broadcast messages and the ability to set up funnels.The Botanalytics tech also claims to be powered by AI (presumably NLP). This makes it possible to track transcripts of any conversation \u2014 including rich media such as video, audio, location and images \u2014 and compare live conversations with historical ones.CEO Ilker Koksal tells me the main difference with Botanalytics compared to competitors is that is it positioning itself as a broader conversational analytics play, including newer voice interfaces, and traditional customer support, not just chatbots. \u201cWe\u2019re analyzing all conversational channels of companies,\u201d he says.To that end, Koksal says Botanalytics\u2019 customers are agencies that build bots for clients and companies with various customer support channels.

{"title": ["Apple\u2019s 2019 Mac Pro will be shaped by workflows"], "text": "A year ago, I visited the Apple campus in Cupertino to figure out where the hell the new Mac Pro was. I joined a round-table discussion with Apple  SVPs and a handful of reporters to get the skinny on what was taking so long.The answer, it turns out, was that Apple had decided to start completely over with the Mac Pro, introduce completely new pro products like the iMac  Pro and refresh the entire MacBook Pro lineup. The reasoning given at the time on the Mac Pro was basically that Apple had painted itself into an architecture corner by being aggressively original on the design of the bullet/turbine/trash-can shaped casing and internal components of the current Mac Pro. There was nothing to be done but start over.The secondary objective to that visit was to reassure pro customers who had not had news of updates in some time that Apple was listening, was working to deliver products for them and generally still cared.Now, one year later, I was invited back to Apple to talk to the people most responsible for shepherding the renewed pro product strategy. John Ternus, vice president of Hardware Engineering, Tom Boger, senior director of Mac Hardware Product Marketing, Jud Coplan, director of Video Apps Product Marketing and Xander Soren, director of Music Apps Product Marketing.The interviews and demos took place over several hours, highlighting the way that Apple is approaching upgradability, development of its pro apps and, most interestingly, how it has changed its process to help it more fully grok how professionals actually use its products.After an initial recap in what they\u2019d done over the past year, including MacBooks and the iMac Pro, I was given the day\u2019s first piece of news: the long-awaited Mac Pro update will not arrive before 2019.When we got the news that it wouldn\u2019t arrive in 2017, there was some implicit messaging that 2018 was not guaranteed either (we were told \u201cnot this year,\u201d but not \u201cdefinitely next year\u201d). This time around, Boger was succinct: the promised Mac Pro will be a 2019 product.\u201cWe want to be transparent and communicate openly with our pro community, so we want them to know that the Mac Pro is a 2019 product. It\u2019s not something for this year.\u201d In addition to transparency for pro customers, there\u2019s also a larger fiscal reason behind it.\u201cWe know that there\u2019s a lot of customers today that are making purchase decisions on the iMac Pro and whether or not they should wait for the Mac Pro,\u201d says Boger. This is why Apple wants to be as explicit as possible now, so that if institutional buyers or other large customers are waiting to spend budget on, say iMac Pros or other machines, they should pull the trigger without worry that a Mac Pro might appear late in the purchasing year. But there have been some other very interesting things going on at Apple since our last Mac Pro update, and they\u2019re shaping the future of all of its pro products.In that discussion a year ago, Apple SVP Phil Schiller acknowledged that pro customers, including developers, were hungry for evidence that Apple was paying attention to their needs.\u201cWe recognize that they want to hear more from us. And so we want to communicate better with them. We want them to understand the importance they have for us, we want them to understand that we\u2019re investing in new Macs \u2014 not only new MacBook Pros and iMacs but Mac Pros for them, we want them to know we are going to work on a display for a modular system,\u201d Schiller said.Now, it\u2019s a year later and\u00a0Apple has created a team inside the building that houses its pro products group. It\u2019s called the Pro Workflow Team, and they haven\u2019t talked about it publicly before today. The group is under John Ternus and works closely with the engineering organization. The bays that I\u2019m taken to later to chat about Final Cut Pro, for instance, are a few doors away from the engineers tasked with making it run great on Apple hardware. \u201cWe said in the meeting last year that the pro community isn\u2019t one thing,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cIt\u2019s very diverse. There\u2019s many different types of pros and obviously they go really deep into the hardware and software and are pushing everything to its limit. So one thing you have to do is we need to be engaging with the customers to really understand their needs. Because we want to provide complete pro solutions, not just deliver big hardware, which we\u2019re doing and we did it with iMac Pro. But look at everything holistically.\u201dTo do that, Ternus says, they want their architects sitting with real customers to understand their actual flow and to see what they\u2019re doing in real time. The challenge with that, unfortunately, is that though customers are typically very responsive when Apple comes calling, it\u2019s not always easy to get what they want because they may be using proprietary content. John Powell, for instance, is a long-time logic user and he\u2019s doing the new Star Wars Han Solo standalone flick. As you can imagine, taking those unreleased and highly secret compositions to Apple to play with on their machines can be a sticking point. So Apple decided to go a step further and just begin hiring these creatives directly into Apple. Some of them on a contract basis but many full-time, as well. These are award-winning artists and technicians that are brought in to shoot real projects (I saw a bunch of them walking by in Apple Park toting kit for an on-premise outdoor shoot). They then put the hardware and software through their paces and point out sticking points that could cause frustration and friction among pro users.Ternus says that they wanted to start focused, then grow the team and disciplines over time.\u201cWe\u2019ve been focusing on visual effects and video editing and 3D animation and music production, as well,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve brought in some pretty incredible talent, really masters of their craft. And so they\u2019re now sitting and building out workflows internally with real content and really looking for what are the bottlenecks. What are the pain points. How can we improve things. And then we take this information where we find it and we go into our architecture team and our performance architects and really drill down and figure out where is the bottleneck. Is it the OS, is it in the drivers, is it in the application, is it in the silicon, and then run it to ground to get it fixed.\u201dThis information has allowed Apple to make machines like the iMac Pro more performant, but also to enable creative users to stay in their flow and keep them moving forward. From personal experience, I can say that the times I felt most frustrated as a professional photographer using a Mac are when I had to wait. When you\u2019re taken out of your rhythm, it creates layers of frustration that can add up to you wanting to flee the platform.\u201cThese aren\u2019t necessarily always fundamental performance issues,\u201d notes Ternus. \u201cThese aren\u2019t things that you\u2019d find in a benchmark or an automated test flow. You know we have examples where we find something\u2026 like it\u2019s a window that a 3D animator uses frequently to make some fine tweaks. The windows are not super graphically intensive in terms of processing and stewing but we have found an issue where that window was taking like 6 to 10 seconds to open and they\u2019re doing that 100 times a day, right? Like \u2018I can\u2019t work on a machine like this, it\u2019s too slow,\u2019 so we dig in and we figure out what it was.\u201cIn that case we found something in the graphics driver was not right, and once you know where to look and you fix it, it completely changes the kind of live-on-ability for that system \u2014 the productivity for that user completely changed.\u201dThis kind of workflow analysis has enabled Apple to find and fix problems that won\u2019t be solved by throwing more hardware at them. An in-depth analysis of how workflow is affected by the whole stack of hardware and software has, Ternus says, helped them to really understand the pain points. He stresses that it\u2019s not just Apple\u2019s applications that they\u2019re testing and working to help make better. Third-party relationships on this are very important to them and the workflow team is helping to fix their problems faster too.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from just, you know, engineering Macs and software to actually engineering a workflow and really understanding from soup to nuts, every single stage of the process, where those bottlenecks are, where we can optimize that,\u201d says Boger. \u201cAnd to JT\u2019s point, because we build the hardware, the firmware, the operating system, the software, and have these close relationships with third parties, we can attack the entire stack and we can really ferret out where we are \u2014 we can optimize for performance.\u201dBut the Pro Workflow Team isn\u2019t just there to fix current bugs. It\u2019s also empowered to make improvements on future products, like the Mac Pro.\u201cWhat\u2019s really powerful through this exercise is that it\u2019s helping us to kind of map out where we\u2019re headed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cBecause we\u2019re really digging in these workflows and figuring out how are the ways we can improve these in the future, and then that can help shape our future plans, as well.\u201dI ask, specifically, whether this means that the Mac Pro will be shaped by this team\u2019s work.\u201cSo it\u2019s definitely influencing the architecture of where we\u2019re going, what we\u2019re planning for,\u201d says Tom Boger. \u201cWe\u2019re getting a much deeper understanding of our pro customers and their workflows and really understanding not only where the state of the art is today but where the state of the art is going, and all of that is really informing the work that we\u2019re doing on the Mac Pro and we\u2019re working really hard on it.\u201dI\u2019m also curious about whether the process over the last year has changed the timeline on the Mac Pro. To be blunt: Is this the original story arc of the Mac Pro\u2019s development, or are we looking at a roadmap that has a fundamentally different timeline than one year ago.\u201cI don\u2019t think that the timeline has fundamentally changed,\u201d says Ternus. \u201cI think this is very much a situation where we want to measure twice and cut once, and we want to make sure we\u2019re building a really well thought-out platform for what our pro customers are doing today. But also with an eye towards what they\u2019re going to be doing in the future, as well. And so to do that right, that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on.\u201dWhile there are no further details on the exact shape that the Mac Pro will take, Boger says they are still very much in the modular mindset.\u201cAs we said a year ago, working on modular was inherently a modular system and in looking at our customers and their workflows obviously that\u2019s a real need for our customers and that\u2019s the direction we\u2019re going,\u201d says Boger.\u201cWell, it\u2019s a need for some of them,\u201d adds Ternus. \u201cI want to be clear that the work that we\u2019re doing as a part of the workflow team is across everything. It\u2019s super relevant for MacBook Pros, it\u2019s super relevant for iMacs and iMac Pros and in the end I think it helps us in dialogue with customers to figure out what are the right systems for you. There is absolutely a need in certain places for modularity. But it\u2019s also really clear that the iMac form factor or the MacBook Pros can be exceptionally good tools.\u201dWhat shape that modularity takes is another matter entirely, of course. I know some people have been pining for the days of internal expansion card configurations with standardized hardware \u2014 and maybe that is the way that this will go. But on Tuesday I also got a tour of the editing suites where Mac hardware and software is pushed to the limits, including extensive use of eGPU support, and a different vision emerges.First, we visit the room where they record new instruments for Logic and Garage Band and then on to an edit bay used by the Pro Workflow Team to put Final Cut Pro through its paces.Throughout, the idea of modularity was omnipresent. An iMac Pro with two iPad Pros hooked up to it allows for direct control, shortcuts and live access to the Logic manual, all while you\u2019re mixing a song on the main device: an eGPU with a MacBook Pro running a live edit of an 8K stream with color grading and effects applied.External GPUs plugged into MacBook Pros, in my opinion, is going to be an enormous shift in the way that people think about portables. I got a live demo of a graphics stress test running on a MacBook Pro natively, then on one and then two external GPUs. The switching is nearly seamless, depending on the age of the app, and some modern rendering software can use all three in concert. It\u2019s one of those things that works exactly the way you think it would, and it leans heavily on Thunderbolt 3.Whether that informs the shape of individual machines in Apple\u2019s future lineup I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s certainly the way Apple is looking at the pro ecosystem. It\u2019s not just MacBook Pro, iMac Pro, Mac Pro \u2014 it\u2019s the enabling force of eGPUs, it\u2019s iPad Pros as input devices, purpose-built extensions and portable workstations. And it\u2019s even iPhone, as Logic and Final Cut Pro are both completely compatible with GarageBand and iMovie. You can start a project and continue it on iOS while traveling, then put it right back into your pro machine when you\u2019re back and continue riffing. It\u2019s Apple leaning into its advantages of having control of this stuff to the bolts.With pros, Apple has three options. It can maintain the same amount of locked-down, tight-lipped comms it applies to its consumer products, where it still feels the reveal is everything.It can utilize a \u201cwhisper campaign\u201d of on-background commentary, quiet liaisons with the developer and professional communities that filter outward in order to quell rumors or allay fears.Or, it can choose to engage in a meaningful way with pros on their actual workflows and ingest their pain points as actionable intel that helps them head off issues before they become headlines or Medium posts or viral Twitter threads. That\u2019s what the Pro Workflow Team is all about.One allegory I see here is when companies hire people to help fix structural problems or improve diversity, but then do not empower them to effect change.In this case it\u2019s heartening to see that there is a straight line between the pros that Apple has hired, the conversations it\u2019s having with contractors who come in to contribute and proactive action taken on products. The work of the Pro Workflow Team is directly affecting the development of the new Mac Pro. And the iMac Pro, Final Cut Pro and macOS. They sit doors away from the engineering team running through real footage and mixing real tracks to figure out what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. And they use a mixture of software, not just Apple\u2019s first-party stuff.This also includes liaising with external mainstays like Adobe to figure out what their major pain points are and figuring out ways to fix them.This isn\u2019t the expected culture of covert insularity in which Apple waits for the complaints to hit critical mass or someone to take it up as a cause before it\u2019s addressed. Frankly, a developer shouldn\u2019t have to complain to someone like me to get a company like Apple to change its mind. They should have their own representatives.And Apple can still have its reveal. All we currently know about the Mac Pro is that it\u2019s modular and that it\u2019s being shaped by the feedback from those pros in-house, as well as external conversations with developers and professional users.My recent conversations with Apple (including the ones cited in this piece, but not those alone) lead me to believe that they know they kept going on a path with pro customers that they felt was working long after it had, in fact, begun to erode. I\u2019m not exactly sure what the timeline was, but given the fact that the Mac Pro won\u2019t arrive until 2019, I\u2019m guessing just before the round-table discussion a year ago.As a side note, by the way, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see any more info about Mac Pro at WWDC in June. Maybe Apple will surprise on that front, but I think for anything further about Mac Pro we\u2019re going to have to wait for next year.In an interesting confluence of themes, I also believe that they had the same revelation recently in the education market. Apple\u2019s second go-round at capturing a big chunk of that market ran aground not on the quality of its hardware or onboard software, but on the tools that were used to deploy and manage that hardware in under-resourced school districts that had already begun to commit to web systems. Apple is starting anew there, as it has begun doing in the pro market over the last year with refreshed hardware and a new approach to addressing performance and operation issues. An interesting note, too, that when it wanted to figure out how to turn the education market around what did it do? Hired teachers and educators to tell them how it works in the real world.As depressing as it has been to see professionals believe that Apple was getting ready to give them up, I find this an interesting and exciting thing to watch. It is very, very hard for a company like Apple \u2014 whose reputation is built on myth building \u2014 to admit that it was mistaken. And it\u2019s even harder to then change course with billions of dollars\u2019 worth of revenue at stake.I\u2019m sure it gives a bunch of people at Apple heartburn, but it\u2019s fascinating for me because I don\u2019t have to pull it off.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/apples-2019-imac-pro-will-be-shaped-by-workflows/"},

{"title": ["Twitter claims more progress on squeezing terrorist content"], "text": "Twitter  has put out its latest Transparency Report providing an update on how many terrorist accounts it has suspended on its platform \u2014 with a cumulative 1.2 million+ suspensions since August 2015.During the reporting period of July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 \u2014 for this, Twitter\u2019s 12th Transparency Report \u2014 the company\u00a0says\u00a0a total of 274,460 accounts were permanently suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism.\u201cThis is down 8.4% from the volume shared in the previous reporting period and is the second consecutive reporting period in which we\u2019ve seen a drop in the number of accounts being suspended for this reason,\u201d it writes. \u201cWe continue to see the positive, significant impact of years of hard work making our site an undesirable place for those seeking to promote terrorism, resulting in this type of activity increasingly shifting away from Twitter.\u201dSix months ago the company claimed big wins in squashing terrorist activity on its platform \u2014 attributing drops in reports of pro-terrorism accounts then to the success of in-house tech tools in driving terrorist activity off its platform\u00a0(and perhaps inevitably rerouting it towards alternative platforms \u2014 Telegram being chief among them, according to experts on online extremism).At that time Twitter reported a total of 299,649 pro-terrorism accounts had been suspended \u2014 which it said was a 20 per cent drop on figures reported for July through December 2016.So the size of the drops are also shrinking. Though it\u2019s suggesting that\u2019s because it\u2019s winning the battle to discourage terrorists from trying in the first place.For its latest reporting period, ending December 2017, Twitter says 93% of the accounts were flagged by its internal tech tools \u2014 with 74% of those also suspended before their first tweet, i.e. before they\u2019d been able to spread any terrorist propaganda.Which means that around a quarter of the pro-terrorist accounts did manage to get out at least one terror tweet.This proportion is essentially unchanged since the last report period (when Twitter reported suspending 75% before their first tweet) \u2014 so whatever tools it\u2019s using to automate terror account identification and blocking appear to be in a steady state, rather than gaining in ability to pre-filter terrorist content.Twitter also specifies that government reports of violations related to the promotion of terrorism represent less than 0.2% of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period \u2014 or 597 to be exact.As with its prior transparency report, a far larger number of Twitter accounts are being reported by governments for \u201cabusive behavior\u201d \u2014 which refers to long-standing problems on Twitter\u2019s platform such as hate speech, racism, misogyny and trolling.And in December a Twitter policy staffer was roasted by UK MPs during a select committee session after the company was again shown failing to\u00a0remove violent, threatening and racist tweets \u2014 which committee staffers had reported months earlier in that case.Twitter\u2019s latest Transparency Report specifies that governments reported 6,254 Twitter accounts for abusive behavior \u2014 yet the company only actioned a quarter of these reports.That\u2019s still up on the prior reporting period, though, when it reported actioning a paltry 12% of these type of reports.The issue of abuse and hate speech on online platforms generally has rocketed up the political agenda in recent years, especially in Europe \u2014 where Germany now has a tough new law to regulate takedowns.Platforms\u2019 content moderation policies certainly remain a bone of contention for governments and lawmakers.Last month the European Commission set out a new rule of thumb for social media platforms \u2014 saying it wants them to\u00a0take down illegal content within an hour of it being reported.This is not legislation yet, but the threat of EU-wide laws being drafted to regulate content takedowns remains a discussion topic \u2014 to encourage platforms to improve performance voluntarily.Where\u00a0terrorist content specifically is concerned, the Commission has also been pushing for increased used by tech firms of what it calls \u201cproactive measures\u201d, including \u201cautomated detection\u201d.And in February the UK government also revealed it had commissioned a local AI firm to build an extremist content blocking tool \u2014 saying it could decide to force companies to use it.So political pressure remains especially high on that front.Returning to abusive content, Twitter\u2019s report specifies that the majority of the tweets and accounts reported to it by governments which it did remove violated its rules in the following areas: impersonation (66%), harassment (16%), and hateful conduct (12%).This is an interesting shift on the mix from the last reported period when Twitter said content was removed for: harassment (37%), hateful conduct (35%), and impersonation (13%).It\u2019s difficult to interpret exactly what that development might mean. One possibility is that impersonation could cover disinformation agents, such as Kremlin bots, which Twitter has being suspending in recent months as part of investigations into election interference \u2014 an issue that\u2019s been shown to be a problem across social media, from Facebook to Tumblr.Governments may also have become more focused on reporting accounts to Twitter that they believe are wrappers for foreign agents to spread false information to try to meddle with democratic processes.In January, for example, the UK government announced it would be setting up a civil service unit to combat state-led disinformation campaigns.And removing an account that\u2019s been identified as a fake \u2014 with the help of government intelligence \u2014 is perhaps easier for Twitter than judging whether a particular piece of robust speech might have crossed the line into harassment or hate speech.Judging the health of conversations on its platform is also something the company recently asked outsiders to help it with. So it doesn\u2019t appear overly confident in making those kind of judgement calls.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/twitter-transparency-report-12/"},

As a result, back in January, Google announced it was taking its $30 million in prize money back, leaving the exciting challenge with a bit of an anticlimactic end.Xprize is back however, announcing today that the show will go on without a cash award or Google support, though they\u2019re looking for a new sponsor to step in and float the prize for the Xprize.\u201cWe are extraordinarily grateful to Google for funding the $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE between September 2007 and March 31st, 2018. While that competition is now over, there are at least five teams with launch contracts that hope to land on the Lunar surface in the next two years,\u201d said Xprize founder Peter H.

Xprize says that Google\u2019s pledge and support eventually netted the teams involved as much as $300 million in investment to fund the missions.Though Google Lunar Xprize stretched on through many deadline extensions only to end without a winner, with this new launch competition, the organization hopes they can capture the public\u2019s imagination once again while hopefully soon also capturing the support of a mega-donor to put their name on the competition.\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t want to give up on these teams, these teams are going to make it,\u201d\u00a0Diamandis said.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/xprize-is-relaunching-its-moon-challenge-without-google-but-they-need-a-new-sponsor/"},
{"title": ["Stripe launches a new billing tool to tap demand from online businesses"], "text": "As more and more spending moves online \u2014 whether that\u2019s shopping or subscribing to services like Netflix and Spotify \u2014 there\u2019s increasing demand for tools that allow those companies, especially smaller ones, to start getting paid.Stripe  has made its name by providing developers with a simpler way to start charging customers and handling transactions, but today they hope to take another step by launching a billing product for online businesses. That\u2019ll allow them to handle subscription recurring revenue, as well as invoicing, within the Stripe platform and get everything all in the same place. The goal was to replace a previously hand-built setup, whether using analog methods for invoicing or painstakingly putting together a set of subscription tools, and make that experience as seamless as charging for products on Stripe.\u201cThese large enterprise companies have the resources to build internal recurring billing in house,\u201d\u00a0Tara Seshan, PM on the billing product, said. \u201cEven then they would tell us what challenge it would be.\u00a0What we did was took a step back and think about, how should this work, how can we make billing tools that are only available to enterprises be available to everyone. That meant something really flexible and really easy to implement. If you\u2019re [running a small operation], you should have the same subscription tools as Spotify. What we have here is a set of building blocks so you get the speed and flexibility you need.\u201dIndeed, a lot of the Internet has slowly but surely shifted to a subscription model. There\u2019s even a good chance that even the phone you have in your pocket is paid for in an annual subscription to amortize the big ticket price of that product over the course of several months. Larger companies have had these tools in place, but it\u2019s a traditional very startup-y problem to just not have the resources to build them even by cobbling together online payments tools in order to get these running. Startups often have a long list of priorities, and they need to start generating revenue immediately if they want to continue growing.This launch is, in part, a response to customers demanding a billing product that gets all these invoices and subscription expenses into a single spot. Stripe at its heart is an enterprise company, which means it has to keep close tabs on the needs of its customers while still balancing the needs to continue creating new products that small businesses didn\u2019t realize would actually solve those problems in an elegant way. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to Internet-oriented businesses, which are often changing their business models over time, Seshan said.\u201cUnlike something like Instagram or Facebook, where you\u2019re doing analytics A/B testing voodoo to figure out what you should build, with Stripe, our businesses know what they want,\u201d Seshan said. \u201cThey have clear requests, so we\u2019re much more inclined to listen to our users as opposed to sitting in an ivory tower coming up with a strategy.\u00a0As they look to add new products, that applies to the startup selling fast and iterating to the large tech companies about to launch a new subscription line or about to add a \u201cfor work\u201d side of their product. What we saw often was that billing was the limiting factor to getting a product to market.\u201dIn addition to all this, Stripe looks to apply the machine learning tools it\u2019s created for things like fraud prevention into a new area of expertise. One example of this is figuring out when to intelligently retry a recurring billing charge, which may fail for any number of reasons. Stripe tries to get around problems like lost credit cards or anything along those lines to try to keep the experience as seamless as possible. Seshan said Stripe businesses that implement billing see a 10% increase in revenue \u2014 which, for flipping a switch, is pretty substantial.As companies get bigger and bigger, they will also likely graduate beyond just a simple subscription. An enterprise software company, for example, will probably have to start targeting larger customers that have a salesforce and a different approach for implementing new technology. That means getting invoice-level revenue, which has different implementation requirements than just normal subscription billing. In that case, it\u2019s not like the CIO of a Fortune 100 company can just put a credit card number into a billing service, as those require more robust research and a partnership in place.While this is a tool that\u2019s a natural fit for something like Stripe, it\u2019s certainly one that\u2019s created a substantial business opportunity. Last month, Zuora \u2014 an enterprise subscription services company \u2014 filed to go public\u00a0amid a fresh wave of enterprise IPOs that included Dropbox and Zscaler (and also, to a certain extent, Salesforce\u2019s big acquisition of Mulesoft). Zuora\u2019s subscription services revenue continues to grow, showing that Stripe will certainly have competition here, but also that there\u2019s a large market opportunity.\u201cWe want to think about Stripe as growing the economic infrastructure to increase the GDP of the Internet,\u201d Seshan said. \u201cWhat we noticed is, we invested in marketplaces in the past, but we\u2019re investing in the next wave of software-as-a-service businesses. We want to power that next trend, and it\u2019s gonna accelerate in the year ahead. We\u2019re really thrilled to power that with billing and subscriptions and we want to make that available to companies with all sizes.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/stripe-launches-a-new-billing-tool-to-tap-demand-from-online-businesses/"},
{"title": ["3 tests show Facebook is determined to make Stories the default"], "text": "Facebook  isn\u2019t backing down from Stories despite criticism that it copied Snapchat and that Instagram Stories is enough. Instead, it\u2019s committed to figuring out how to adapt the slideshow format into the successor to the status update. That\u2019s why today the company is launching three significant tests that make Facebook Stories a default way to share.\u201cThe way people share and connect is changing; it\u2019s quickly becoming more real-time and visual. We\u2019re testing new creative tools to bring pictures and videos to life, and introducing easier ways to find and share stories,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told me.Meanwhile, Facebook has been fixing the biggest problems with its Stories: redundancy between Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. Now you can set your Instagram Stories to automatically be reposted to your Facebook Story, and Stories on Facebook and Messenger sync with each other. That means you can just post to Instagram and have your Story show up on all three apps. That way if you want extra views or to include friends who aren\u2019t Insta-addicts, you can show them your Story with no extra uploads.It was a year ago that Facebook rolled out Stories. But Facebook has so many features that it has to make tough decisions about which to promote and which to bury. It often launches features with extra visibility at first, but forces them to grow popular on their own before giving them any additional attention.Facebook is vulnerable to competitors if it doesn\u2019t make Stories work, and users may eventually grow tired of the News Feed full of text updates from distant acquaintances. But Instagram Stories and WhatsApp\u2019s version Status have both grown to more than 250 million daily users, showing there\u2019s obviously demand for this product if Facebook can figure out how Stories fit in its app.Hence, these tests:If Facebook finds these tests prove popular, they could roll out everywhere and make Stories a much more central part of the app\u2019s experience. Facebook will have to avoid users feeling like Stories are getting crammed down their throats. But the open camera, Stories default and bigger previews all disappear with a quick tap or swipe.The fact is that the modern world of computing affords a very different type of social media than when Facebook launched 14 years ago. Then, you\u2019d update your status with a line of text from your desktop computer because your phone didn\u2019t have a good camera (or maybe even the internet), screens were small, mobile networks were slow and it was tough to compute on the go. Now with every phone equipped with a great camera, a nice screen, increasingly fast mobile networks and everyone else staring at them all the time, it makes sense to share through photos and videos you post throughout the day.This isn\u2019t a shift driven by Facebook, or even really Snapchat. Visual communication is an inevitable evolution. For Facebook, Stories aren\u2019t an \u201cif,\u201d just a \u201chow.\u201d", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/facebook-stories-default/"},
{"title": ["Our digital future will be shaped by increasingly mobile technologies coming from China"], "text": "Since the dawn of the internet, the titans of this industry have fought to win the \u201cstarting point\u201d \u2014 the place that users start their online experiences. In other words, the place where they begin \u201cbrowsing.\u201d The advent of the dial-up era had America Online mailing a CD to every home in America, which passed the baton to Yahoo\u2019s  categorical listings, which was swallowed by Google\u2019s indexing of the world\u2019s information \u2014 winning the \u201cstarting point\u201d was everything.As the mobile revolution continues to explode across the world, the battle for the starting point has intensified. For a period of time, people believed it would be the hardware, then it became clear that the software mattered most. Then conversation shifted to a debate between operating systems (Android or iOS) and moved on to social properties and messaging apps, where people were spending most of their time. Today, my belief is we\u2019re hovering somewhere between apps and operating systems. That being said, the interface layer will always be evolving.The starting point, just like a rocket\u2019s launchpad, is only important because of what comes after. The battle to win that coveted position, although often disguised as many other things, is really a battle to become the starting point of commerce. \u00a0Google\u2019s  philosophy includes a commitment to get users \u201coff their page\u201d as quickly as possible\u2026to get that user to form a habit and come back to their starting point. The real (yet somewhat veiled) goal, in my opinion, is to get users to search and find the things they want to buy.Of course, Google \u201cdoes no evil\u201d while aggregating the world\u2019s information, but they pay their bills by sending purchases to Priceline, Expedia,  Amazon  and the rest of the digital economy. \u00a0Facebook,  on the other hand, has become a starting point through its monopolization of users\u2019 time, attention and data. Through this effort, it\u2019s developed an advertising business that shatters records quarter after quarter.Google and Facebook, this famed duopoly, represent 89 percent of new advertising spending in 2017. Their dominance is unrivaled\u2026 for now.Change is urgently being demanded by market forces \u2014 shifts in consumer habits, intolerable rising costs to advertisers and through a nearly universal dissatisfaction with the advertising models that have dominated (plagued) the U.S. digital economy.\u00a0 All of which is being accelerated by mobile. Terrible experiences for users still persist in our online experiences, deliver low efficacy for advertisers and fraud is rampant. The march away from the glut of advertising excess may be most symbolically seen in the explosion of ad blockers. Further evidence of the \u201cneed for a correction of this broken industry\u201d is Oracle\u2019s willingness to pay $850 million for a company that polices ads (probably the best entrepreneurs I know ran this company, so no surprise).As an entrepreneur, my job is to predict the future. When reflecting on what I\u2019ve learned thus far in my journey, it\u2019s become clear that two truths can guide us in making smarter decisions about our digital future:Every day, retailers, advertisers, brands and marketers get smarter. This means that every day, they will push the platforms, their partners and the places they rely on for users to be more \u201cperformance driven.\u201d More transactional.Paying for views, bots (Russian or otherwise) or anything other than \u201cdollars\u201d will become less and less popular over time. It\u2019s no secret that Amazon, the world\u2019s most powerful company (imho), relies so heavily on its Associates Program (its home-built partnership and affiliate platform). This channel is the highest performing form of paid acquisition that retailers have, and in fact, it\u2019s rumored that the success of Amazon\u2019s affiliate program led to the development of AWS due to large spikes in partner traffic.When thinking about our digital future, look down and look east. Look down and admire your phone \u2014 this will serve as your portal to the digital world for the next decade, and our dependence will only continue to grow. The explosive adoption of this form factor is continuing to outpace any technological trend in history.Now, look east and recognize that what happens in China will happen here, in the West, eventually. The Chinese market skipped the PC-driven digital revolution \u2014 and adopted the digital era via the smartphone. Some really smart investors have built strategies around this thesis and have quietly been reaping rewards due to their clairvoyance. \u00a0China has historically been categorized as a market full of knock-offs and copycats \u2014 but times have changed. Some of the world\u2019s largest and most innovative companies have come out of China over the past decade. The entrepreneurial work ethic in China (as praised recently by arguably the world\u2019s greatest investor, Michael Moritz), the speed of innovation and the ability to quickly scale and reach meaningful populations have caused Chinese companies to leapfrog the market cap of many of their U.S. counterparts. \u00a0The most interesting component of the Chinese digital economy\u2019s growth is that it is fundamentally more \u201cpure\u201d than the U.S. market\u2019s. I say this because the Chinese market is inherently \u201ctransactional.\u201d As Andreessen Horowitz writes, WeChat,  China\u2019s \u00a0most valuable company, has become the \u201cstarting point\u201d and hub for all user actions. Their revenue diversity is much more \u201cAmazon\u201d than \u201cGoogle\u201d or \u201cFacebook\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s much more pure. They make money off the transactions driven from their platform, and advertising is far less important in their strategy.The obsession with replicating WeChat took the tech industry by storm two years ago \u2014 and for some misplaced reason, everyone thought we needed to build messaging bots to compete.\u00a0\u00a0What shouldn\u2019t be lost is our obsession with the purity and power of the business models being created in China. The fabric that binds the Chinese digital economy and has fostered its seemingly boundless growth is the magic combination of commerce and mobile. Singles Day, the Chinese version of Black Friday, drove $25 billion\u00a0in sales on Alibaba  \u2014 90 percent of which were on mobile.The lesson we\u2019ve learned thus far in both the U.S. and in China is that \u201cconsumers spending money\u201d creates the most durable consumer businesses. Google, putting aside all its moonshots and heroic mission statements, is a \u201cstarting point\u201d powered by a shopping engine. If you disagree, look at where their revenue comes from\u2026Google\u2019s recent announcement of Shopping Actions and their movement to a \u201cpay per transaction model\u201d signals a turning point that could forever change the landscape of the digital economy. \u00a0Google\u2019s multi-front battle against Apple,  Facebook and Amazon is weighted. Amazon is the most threatening. It\u2019s the most durable business of the four \u2014 and its model is unbounded on two fronts that almost everyone I know would bet their future on, 1) people buying more online, where Amazon makes a disproportionate amount of every dollar spent, and 2) companies needing more cloud computing power (more servers), where Amazon makes a disproportionate amount of every dollar spent. \u00a0To add insult to injury, Amazon is threatening Google by becoming a starting point itself \u2014 55 percent of product searches now originate at Amazon,\u00a0up from 30 percent just a year ago.Google, recognizing consumer behavior was changing in mobile (less searching) and the inferiority of their model when compared to the durability and growth prospects of Amazon, needed to respond. Google needed a model that supported boundless growth and one that created a \u201cwin-win\u201d for its advertising partners \u2014 one that resembled Amazon\u2019s relationship with its merchants \u2014 not one that continued to increase costs to retailers while capitalizing on their monopolization of search traffic.Google knows that with its position as the starting point \u2014 with Google.com, Google Apps and Android \u2014 it has to become a part of the transaction to prevail in the long term. With users in mobile demanding fewer ads and more utility (demanding experiences that look and feel a lot more like what has prevailed in China), Google has every reason in the world to look down and to look east \u2014 to become a part of the transaction \u2014 to take its piece. \u00a0A collision course for Google and the retailers it relies upon for revenue was on the horizon. Search activity per user was declining in mobile and user acquisition costs were growing quarter over quarter. Businesses are repeatedly failing to compete with Amazon, and unless Google could create an economically viable growth model for retailers, no one would stand a chance against the commerce juggernaut \u2014 not the retailers nor Google itself.\u00a0As I\u2019ve believed for a long time, becoming a part of the transaction is the most favorable business model for all parties; sources of traffic make money when retailers sell things, and, most importantly, this only happens when users find the things they want. \u00a0Shopping Actions is Google\u2019s first ambitious step to satisfy all three parties \u2014 businesses and business models all over the world will feel this impact. \u00a0Good work, Sundar.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/our-digital-future-will-be-shaped-by-increasingly-mobile-technologies-coming-from-china/"},

{"title": ["News startup Knowhere aims to break through partisan echo chambers"], "text": "It\u2019s become\u00a0a common complaint that social media allows everyone to limit their news consumption to stories that reinforce what they already believe. But the team at Knowhere says it\u2019s found a solution: News stories written by machines.The idea is that Knowhere\u2019s  technology can eliminate some of the in-built human bias, and also pull from a wide variety of sources and write stories with enormous speed. For controversial and political news, it doesn\u2019t limit itself to one story. Instead, it allows you to jump between versions of the story that are written from a left, right or \u201cimpartial\u201d perspective.\u201cI want to establish a source of record that\u2019s indisputably trustworthy for everyone from across all aisles,\u201d said CEO and Editor-in-Chief Nathaniel Barling. \u201cAs a Knowhere reader what you are signing up for is the truth and the full context around it.\u201dAt first, I wondered whether Knowhere might simply deepen the same divisions that it claims to fight. Might this approach just reinforce the idea that every piece of news should be interpreted according to our ideological leanings? Or that we can dismiss an accurate piece of reporting by, say, The New York Times because The Times has been painted as a liberal paper?When I brought this up, Barling said Knowhere is focused on facts, even if those facts (say, the scientific consensus around climate change) are sometimes disputed for political reasons.Barling\u2019s father Kurt was a longtime reporter at the BBC, and Barling recalled a conversation between the two of them on this topic: \u201cThe truth doesn\u2019t care for your politics. What we must do is evaluate all of the evidence that we possibly have available to us, then come to the most accurate conclusion regardless of political stripe.\u201dSo the Knowhere stories that I\u2019ve read tend to be very straightforward and focus on facts that have been corroborated by reputable publications. The left-leaning version of the article might be written so those facts add up to one narrative, while the right-leaning version might tell a different story, but they still agree on the core facts. (And some stories \u2014 including most of the ones I read in the Technology section \u2014 don\u2019t include multiple spins, just the impartial version.)And while Knowhere articles are created by machine learning technology (Barling\u2019s co-founders Alexandre Elkrief and Dylan Rhodes are both data scientists), they\u2019re all reviewed by human journalists. In fact, he said there are already eight journalists on his team, making up for half of Knowhere\u2019s headcount \u2014 a ratio that he hopes to maintain as the company grows.Facebook has also been making efforts to show different perspectives on a story, particularly if the story\u2019s accuracy is disputed. When I pointed this out, Barling said, \u201cThey do recognize the scale of the issue, but they\u2019re not well-placed to execute on it because of their philosophical stand. As you said, they don\u2019t want to be the arbiters of truth.\u201dIn addition to launching today, Knowhere announced that it has raised $1.8 million in seed funding from investors, including CrunchFund, Danhua Capital, Day One Ventures, Struck Capital and Abstract Ventures.

{"title": ["Highlights and audio from Zuckerberg\u2019s emotional Q&A on scandals"], "text": "\u201cThis is going to be a never-ending battle,\u201d said Mark Zuckerberg. He just gave the most candid look yet into his thoughts about Cambridge Analytica, data privacy and Facebook\u2019s sweeping developer platform changes during a conference call with reporters today. Sounding alternately vulnerable about his past negligence and confident about Facebook\u2019s  strategy going forward, Zuckerberg took nearly an hour of tough questions.You can read a transcript here\u00a0and listen to a recording of the call below:\ufeffThe CEO started the call by giving his condolences to those affected by the shooting at YouTube yesterday. He then delivered this mea culpa on privacy:This is Zuckerberg\u2019s strongest statement yet about his and Facebook\u2019s failure to anticipate worst-case scenarios,\u00a0which has led to a string of scandals that are now decimating the company\u2019s morale. Spelling out how policy means nothing without enforcement, and pairing that with a massive reduction in how much data app developers can request from users makes it seem like Facebook is ready to turn over a new leaf.Here are the highlights from the rest of the call:On Zuckerberg calling fake news\u2019 influence \u201ccrazy\u201d: \u201cI clearly made a mistake by just dismissing fake news as crazy \u2014 as having an impact \u2026 it was too flippant. I never should have referred to it as crazy.On deleting Russian trolls: Not only did Facebook delete 135 Facebook and Instagram accounts belonging to Russian government-connected election interference troll farm the Internet Research Agency, as Facebook announced yesterday, Zuckerberg said Facebook removed \u201ca Russian news organization that we determined was controlled and operated by the IRA.\u201dOn the 87 million number: Regarding today\u2019s disclosure that up to 87 million people had their data improperly accessed by Cambridge Analytica,  \u201cit very well could be less but we wanted to put out the maximum that we felt it could be as soon as we had that analysis.\u201d Zuckerberg also referred to The New York Times\u2019 report, noting that\u00a0\u201cWe never put out the 50 million number, that was other parties.\u201dOn users having their public info scraped: Facebook announced this morning that \u201cwe believe most people on Facebook could have had their public profile scraped\u201d via its search by phone number or email address feature and account recovery system. Scammers abused these to punch in one piece of info and then pair it to someone\u2019s name and photo. Zuckerberg said search features are useful in languages where it\u2019s hard to type or a lot of people have the same names. But \u201cthe methods of react limiting this weren\u2019t able to prevent malicious actors who cycled through hundreds of thousands of IP addresses and did a relatively small number of queries for each one, so given that and what we know to day it just makes sense to shut that down.\u201dOn when Facebook learned about the scraping and why it didn\u2019t inform the public sooner:\u00a0 \u201cWe looked into this and understood it more over the last few days as part of the audit of our overall system,\u201d Zuckerberg said, declining to specify when Facebook first identified the issue. [Update: Facebook later specified that the sophisticated scraping had been picked up in the past few weeks during the audit, recently confirmed, and that the company disclosed the situation as soon as it had details ready.]On implementing GDPR worldwide: Zuckerberg refuted a Reuters story from yesterday saying that Facebook wouldn\u2019t bring GDPR privacy protections to the U.S. and elsewhere. Instead he says, \u201cwe\u2019re going to make all the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.\u201dOn if board has discussed him stepping down as chairman: \u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Zuckerberg said happily.On if he still thinks he\u2019s the best person to run Facebook: \u201cYes. Life is about learning from the mistakes and figuring out what you need to do to move forward \u2026 I think what people should evaluate us on is learning from our mistakes \u2026 and if we\u2019re building things people like and that make their lives better \u2026 there are billions of people who love the products we\u2019re building.\u201dOn the Boz memo and prioritizing business over safety: \u201cThe things that makes our product challenging to manage and operate are not the trade-offs between people and the business. I actually think those are quite easy because over the long-term, the business will be better if you serve people. I think it would be near-sighted to focus on short-term revenue over people, and\u00a0I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that short-sighted. All the hard decisions we have to make are trade-offs between people. Different people who use Facebook have different needs. Some people want to share political speech that they think is valid, and other people feel like it\u2019s hate speech \u2026 we don\u2019t always get them right.\u201dOn whether Facebook can audit all app developers: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to go out and necessarily find every bad use of data,\u201d Zuckerberg said, but confidently said, \u201cI\u00a0actually do think we\u2019re going to be able to cover a large amount of that activity.\u201dOn whether Facebook will sue Cambridge Analytica: \u201cWe have stood down temporarily to let the [U.K. government] do their investigation and their audit. Once that\u2019s done we\u2019ll resume ours \u2026 and ultimately to make sure none of the data persists or is being used improperly. And at that point if it makes sense we will take legal action if we need to do that to get people\u2019s information.\u201dOn how Facebook will measure its impact on fixing privacy: Zuckerberg wants to be able to measure \u201cthe prevalence of different categories of bad content like fake news, hate speech, bullying, terrorism \u2026 That\u2019s going to end up being the way we should be held accountable and measured by the public \u2026 My hope is that over time the playbook and scorecard we put out will also be followed by other internet platforms so that way there can be a standard measure across the industry.\u201dOn whether Facebook should try to earn less money by using less data for targeting: \u201cPeople tell us if they\u2019re going to see ads they want the ads to be good \u2026 that the ads are actually relevant to what they care about \u2026 On the one hand people want relevant experiences, and on the other hand I do think there\u2019s some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads. But I think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience. Maybe it\u2019s 95-5.\u201dOn whether #DeleteFacebook has had an impact on usage or ad revenue: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any meaningful impact that we\u2019ve observed\u2026 but it\u2019s not good.\u201dOn the timeline for fixing data privacy: \u201cThis is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security. It\u2019s an arms race,\u201d Zuckerberg said early in the call. Then to close Q&A, he said, \u201cI think this is a multi-year effort. My hope is that by the end of this year we\u2019ll have turned the corner on a lot of these issues and that people will see that things are getting a lot better.\u201dOverall, this was the moment of humility, candor and contrition Facebook desperately needed. Users, developers, regulators and the company\u2019s own employees have felt in the dark this last month, but Zuckerberg did his best to lay out a clear\u00a0path forward for Facebook. His willingness to endure these questions was admirable, even if he deserved the grilling.The company\u2019s problems won\u2019t disappear, and its past transgressions can\u2019t be apologized away. But Facebook and its leader have finally matured past the incredulous dismissals\u00a0and paralysis that characterized its response to past scandals. It\u2019s ready to get to work.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/zuckerberg-raw/"},
{"title": ["Alibaba is preparing to invest in Grab"], "text": "Fresh from announcing a deal to buy out Uber in Southeast Asia, Grab looks set to gain further firepower with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba preparing to invest in the ride-hailing firm.Alibaba  is in the early stages of making an investment in Grab, two sources with knowledge of discussions told TechCrunch. Isn\u2019t yet clear what size that might be or at what valuation for Grab,  which was last valued by investors at $6 billion.In addition, the timing is unclear due to current anti-trust investigations into the Grab-Uber  deal. The\u00a0Competition Commission of Singapore has said there are\u00a0grounds to believe the merger may violate the\u00a0law,\u00a0while other countries are looking into its implications. But still, there is intent from both sides and key investor SoftBank to make the deal.Grab declined to comment for this story. An Alibaba spokesperson said the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t confirm on market rumors.\u201dAlibaba and Grab first held talks over an investment last summer\u00a0but a deal never materialized after the Chinese firm became pre-occupied chasing an investment in Tokopedia, the Indonesia-based e-commerce unicorn. That deal was prioritized because Alibaba\u2019s arch-rival Tencent was in advanced talks over an investment that could give it a foothold in Indonesia, Southeast Asia\u2019s largest economy and the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.Alibaba leaned heavily on its long-time ally SoftBank  \u2014 an early backer of Tokopedia and Grab \u2014 to get the Tokopedia deal ahead of Tencent. That\u2019s despite Tokopedia\u2019s own founders\u2019 preference for Tencent  due to Alibaba\u2019s ownership of Lazada, an e-commerce rival to\u00a0Tokopedia. SoftBank, however, forced the deal through.\u201cIt was literally SoftBank against every other investor,\u201d a separate source with knowledge of negotiations told TechCrunch.Ultimately, Alibaba was successful and it led a $1.1 billion investment in Tokopedia\u00a0in August which did not include Tencent.TechCrunch understands that one condition SoftBank attached to the Tokopedia deal was that Alibaba would invest in Grab when the time was right. SoftBank is widely seen to have been the deal-maker in the recent Grab-Uber consolidation and now, with that transaction agreed, Alibaba\u2019s investment will follow.The timing may be ideal for Grab. While it has plenty of money in the bank from past investments, Indonesian rival Go-Jek is preparing to expand into regional markets so the firm will need to brace itself for a new wave of competition.Despite the background, this is far from Alibaba being strong-armed into an investment, a deal with Grab makes plenty of sense for the firm.It has been actively seeking investment deals in Southeast Asia\u2019s top internet companies for some time, and Grab clearly fits the bill. In particular, Grab\u2019s focus on payments and its recently announced financial services play\u00a0is aligned with Alibaba and its fintech arm Ant Financial\u2019s goals, too.Last year, Ant Financial went on an investment spree which included multiple investments deals across Southeast Asia and the failed acquisition of MoneyGram. Involvement in Grab Pay, which is shaping up to be a major payment player across the region, would massively boost Alibaba and Ant\u2019s objective.Finally, there\u2019s the good old competition factor.\u00a0With Tencent an investor in Grab rival Go-Jek, Alibaba has motivation enough to back a horse in Southeast Asia\u2019s ride-hailing space.As I wrote last year, the two Chinese internet giants have been carving up Southeast Asia\u2019s most promising startups in search of investments that give them a good position as the region\u2019s internet economy grows.A report co-authored by Google last year forecast\u00a0that Southeast Asia\u2019s internet economy will grow to $200 billion in 2025 from $50 billion in 2017. Right now, it is Chinese companies, not those from the U.S., that are seizing the opportunity.Got a news tip?

{"title": ["Google pay discrimination lawsuit is moving forward"], "text": "A class-action lawsuit alleging pay discrimination at Google  based on gender is moving forward, California Superior Court Judge Mary E. Wiss recently ordered.The original suit was dismissed in December due to the fact that plaintiffs defined the class of affected workers too broadly. In January, the plaintiffs filed a revised lawsuit, which added Heidi Lamar, a former teacher at Google\u2019s Children Center in Palo Alto. The revised January lawsuit focuses on those who hold engineer, manager, sales or early childhood education positions, which comes out to 30 covered positions. The suit also alleges Google has a history of improperly asking about prior salaries and assigning women to lower job levels with lower salaries.In court, Google objected to the class-action designation pertaining to \u201cEngineer Covered Positions\u201d and \u201cProgram Manager Covered Positions,\u201d saying the plaintiffs did not allege specific violations. But Judge Wiss has since said the court was not persuaded by Google\u2019s argument.\u201cIt is enough for Plaintiff\u2019s to allege a numerous and ascertainable class with a well-defined community of interest, as well as a pattern or practice of gender discrimination across all Covered Positions in Google,\u201d Wiss wrote in her order.When reached for comment, Google reiterated an earlier statement it provided to journalists.\u201cWe work really hard to create a great workplace for everyone, and to give everyone the chance to thrive here,\u201d Google spokesperson Gina Scigliano said. \u201cIn relation to this particular lawsuit, we\u2019ll review it in detail, but we disagree with the central allegations. Job levels and promotions are determined through rigorous hiring and promotion committees, and must pass multiple levels of review, including checks to make sure there is no gender bias in these decisions. And we have extensive systems in place to ensure that we pay fairly.

{"title": ["Should AI researchers kill people?"], "text": "AI research is increasingly being used by militaries around the world for offensive and defensive applications. This past week, groups of AI researchers began to fight back against two separate programs located halfway around the world from each other, generating tough questions about just how much engineers can affect the future uses of these technologies.From Silicon Valley, The New York Times published an internal protest memo written by several thousand Google  employees, which vociferously opposed Google\u2019s work on a Defense Department-led initiative called Project Maven, which aims to use computer vision algorithms to analyze vast troves of image and video data.As the department\u2019s news service quoted Marine Corps Col. Drew Cukor last year about the initiative:Google\u2019s employees are demanding that the company step back from exactly that sort of partnership, writing in their memo:Meanwhile, in South Korea, there is growing outrage over a program to develop offensive robots jointly created by the country\u2019s top engineering university KAIST \u2014 the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology \u2014 and Korean conglomerate Hanhwa, which among other product lines is one of the largest producers of munitions for the country. Dozens of AI academics around the world have initiated a protest of the collaboration, writing that:Here\u2019s the thing: These so-called \u201ckiller robots\u201d are seriously the least of our concerns. Such offensive technology is patently obvious, and researchers are free to decide whether they want to participate or not participate in such endeavors.The wider challenge for the field is that all artificial intelligence research is equally applicable to offensive technologies as it is to improving the human condition. The entire research program around AI is to create new capabilities for computers to perceive, predict, decide and act without human intervention. For researchers, the best algorithms are idealized and generalizable, meaning that they should apply to any new subject with some tweaks and maybe more training data.Practically, there is no way to prevent these newfound capabilities from entering offensive weapons. Even if the best researchers in the world refused to work on technologies that abetted offensive weapons, others could easily take these proven models \u201coff the shelf\u201d and apply them relatively straightforwardly to new applications. That\u2019s not to say that battlefield applications don\u2019t have their own challenges that need to be figured out, but developing core AI capabilities is the critical block in launching these sorts of applications.AI is a particularly vexing problem of dual-use \u2014 the ability of a technology to be used for both positive applications and negative ones. A good example is nuclear theory, which can be used to massively improve human healthcare through magnetic resonance imagery and power our societies with nuclear power reactors, or it can be used in a bomb to kill hundreds of thousands.AI is challenging because unlike, say, nuclear weapons, which require unique hardware that signals their development to other powers, AI has no such requirements. For all the talk of Tensor Processing Units, the key innovations in AI are mathematical and software in origin, before hardware performance optimization. We could build an autonomous killing drone today with a consumer-grade drone, a robotic gun trigger and computer vision algorithms downloaded from GitHub. It may not be perfect, but it would \u201cwork.\u201d In this way, it is similar to bioweapons, which can similarly be built with standard lab equipment.Other than outright stopping development of artificial intelligence capabilities entirely, this technology is going to get built, which means it is absolutely possible to build these weapons and launch them against adversaries.In other words, AI researchers are going to kill people, whether they like it or not.Given that context, the right mode for organizing isn\u2019t to stop Google from working with the Pentagon, it is to encourage Google, which is among the most effective lobbying forces in Washington, to push for more international negotiations to ban these sorts of offensive weapons in the first place. Former Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt chairs the Defense Innovation Board, and has a perfect perch from which to make these concerns known to the right policymakers. Such negotiations have been effective in limiting bioweapons, chemical warfare and weapons in outer space, even during the height of the Cold War. There is no reason to believe that success is out of reach.That said, one challenge with this vision is competition from China. China has made autonomous warfare a priority, investing billions into the industry in pursuit of new tools to fight American military hegemony. Even if the U.S. and the world wanted to avoid these weapons, we may not have much of a choice. I, for one, would prefer to see the world\u2019s largest dictatorship not acquire these weapons without any sort of countermeasure from the democratized world.It\u2019s important to note, though, that such fears about war and technology are hardly new. Computing power was at the heart of the \u201cprecision\u201d bombing campaigns in Vietnam throughout the 1960s, and significant campus protests were focused on stopping newly founded computation centers from conducting their work. In many cases, classified research was banned from campus, and ROTC programs were similarly removed, only to be reinstated in recent years. The Pugwash conferences were conceived in the 1950s as a forum for scientists concerned about the global security implications of emerging technologies, namely nuclear energy.These debates will continue, but we need to be aware that all AI developments will likely lead to better offensive weapons capabilities. Better to accept that reality today and work to protect the ethical norms of war than try to avoid it, only to discover that other adversaries have taken the AI lead \u2014 and international power with it.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/should-ai-researchers-kill-people/"},

{"title": ["How 3D printing is revolutionizing healthcare as we know it"], "text": "In 1983, Chuck Hall, the father of 3D printing, created something that was equal parts simple and earth-shattering. He manufactured the world\u2019s first-ever 3D printer and used it to print a tiny eye wash cup.It was just a cup. It was small and black and utterly ordinary looking. But that cup paved the way for a quiet revolution, one that today is changing the healthcare industry in dramatic ways.As healthcare costs in America continue to skyrocket, with no political solution in sight, this technology could offer some direly needed relief.Here are just some the ways in which 3D printing is already revolutionizing the healthcare industry.I love to tell the story of Amanda Boxtel, who came to me a few years ago complaining that her robotic suit, a gorgeous piece of design from Ekso Bionics, was uncomfortable to wear. Amanda is paralyzed from the waist down, and while this suit gave her the gift of movement, it couldn\u2019t give her the symmetry and freedom of range of motion that she, like all humans, craved.Unlike traditional prosthetics, which are mass-manufactured like any other traditional factory-produced good, 3D-printed prosthetics are custom-tailored for each individual user. By digitally capturing Amanda\u2019s unique measurements, I was able to build her a custom-fit suit, much like a tailor would, creating a beautiful, lightweight design that fit Amanda\u2019s body down to each distinct millimeter.This same technology is now being harnessed to create beautiful conformal ventilated scoliosis braces, supports for amputees and more.Writing in a recent issue of the Medical Journal of Australia, the surgeon Jason Chuen alerted his colleagues to a\u00a0major technological breakthrough that could eventually do away with the need for human organ transplants. Here\u2019s how it works:3D printing is performed by telling a computer to apply layer upon layer of a specific material (quite often plastic or metal powders), molding them one layer at a time until the final product \u2014 be it a toy, a pair of sunglasses or a scoliosis brace \u2014 is built. Medical technology is now harnessing this technology and building tiny organs, or \u201corganoids,\u201d using the same techniques, but with stem cells as the production material. These organoids, once built, will in the future be able to grow inside the body of a sick patient and take over when an organic organ, such as a kidney or liver, fails.It may sound like something out of Mary Shelley\u2019s \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d but the implications \u2014 and cost savings \u2014 make this technological breakthrough in 3D printing particularly immense. For centuries, burn victims have had incredibly limited options for healing their disfigured skin. Skin grafts are painful and produce terrible aesthetics; hydrotherapy solutions offer limited results. But researchers in Spain have now taken the mechanics of 3D printing \u2014 that same careful layer-upon-layer approach in which we can make just about anything \u2014 and revealed a\u00a03D bioprinter prototype that can produce human skin. The researchers, working with a biological ink that contains both human plasma as well as material extracts taken from skin biopsies, were able to print about 100 square centimeters of human skin in the span of about half an hour. The possibilities for this technology, and the life-changing implications for burn victims, are endless.Finally, 3D printing also has the potential to upend the pharmaceutical world and vastly simplify daily life for patients with multiple ailments. So many of us take dozens of pills each day or week, and the organization, timing and monitoring of these multiple medications and their diverse drug interactions and requirements (morning, night, with or without food) is utterly exhausting.But 3D printing is the epitome of precision. A 3D-printed pill, unlike a traditionally manufactured capsule, can house multiple drugs at once, each with different release times.\u00a0This so-called \u201cpolypill\u201d concept\u00a0has already been tested for patients with diabetes and is showing great promise.The medical world, in which treatments, organs and devices are an integral part, stands to be revolutionized by the vast promises of 3D printing. With precision, speed and a major slash in cost, the way we treat and manage the health of our bodies will never be the same. And that\u2019s something to celebrate.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/bioprinted-organs-skin-and-drugs-how-3d-printing-is-revolutionizing-healthcare-as-we-know-it/"},

{"title": ["Machine Learning Zone: OpenAI competition takes on Sonic the Hedgehog"], "text": "Retro video games have been a useful platform for machine learning research for years, and the systems created have been creeping through the classics, mastering them as they go. Sonic the Hedgehog may be the next to fall: OpenAI has announced a competition to apply machine learning to the classic Sega game.It\u2019s not vastly different from what\u2019s been attempted before, things like playing Super Mario Bros or Space Invaders, or even the likes of Doom. But the rules are a bit different here.A very basic summary of how AIs learn to play something like Mario is this: an algorithm is set up with some basic capabilities like recognizing objects on screen and monitoring the in-game score. It\u2019s then set free on the game itself and allowed access to the controls, with the sole goal of maximizing its score.Over millions of tries the machine learns that in order to score, it needs to hit start first, then that it needs to move to the right, then that goombas kill it (and stop it from scoring more), coins give it points and so on. It does this all basically from recognizing the shapes on the screen or, in some cases, from accessing the game geometry and system memory directly \u2014 it doesn\u2019t care about the Princess, and it may develop strange behaviors that result from its single-minded pursuit of incrementing its score integer.This one, for example, learned that it can glitch through the walls to get ahead quickly:Great job!Another thing the OpenAI  folks point out is that these systems often learn on the games and levels on which they are evaluated. It\u2019s a sort of \u201cteaching to the test\u201d situation. So in the new competition, not only are the systems more complicated than Mario\u2019s (as anyone who\u2019s played Sonic can tell you), but the systems created will be tested on levels to which they\u2019ve had limited exposure.They won\u2019t be going in blind \u2014 the risk of an AI breaking from the first is too high. But while researchers will have all the time in the world to design a training and learning mechanism based on a selection of Sonic levels, the test will involve applying that training mechanism to a new set of levels, under a strict time limit (18 hours of game time).This means you have to create an agent that understands not just one level of Sonic, but Sonic as a gestalt. If your AI knows all the shortcuts in Green Valley Zone, it may excel there, but when sent to the Chemical Zone, it\u2019ll choke (like me) when it encounters the scary underwater parts.You don\u2019t jump like normal! It\u2019s a lot of pressure with the stuff coming up!It also means your algorithm has to train efficiently, which may involve all kinds of techniques and shortcuts. Minimizing training time means minimizing lazy learning and paying attention to multiple sources of information at once.There are also different control methods, gimmicks and physics in each game, so it may be that identifying those before making the run could be critical to success. Really, there are all kinds of things to consider. (It\u2019s making me want to go back and play these great games.)Contestants will be using OpenAI\u2019s Gym Retro platform, which essentially wraps an emulator playing Sonic (and a set of other Sega games) in the tools developers need to extract data, map inputs and so on.Winners don\u2019t get any cash or anything, but first through third place will get trophies and will have the opportunity to co-author a report on the contest. OpenAI\u2019s reports are interesting and widely read, so it sounds like a good opportunity if you have the time and inclination \u2014 although, of course, \u201cit\u2019s great exposure\u201d is the classic payment avoidance strategy.There are lots more games in the package of games OpenAI is using \u2014 I\u2019d like to see an AI take on Gunstar Heroes, or Golden Axe III.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/machine-learning-zone-openai-competition-takes-on-sonic-the-hedgehog/"},
{"title": ["3D movie box office totals take another dive"], "text": "Could it be that the scourge of 3D film is coming to an end? The box office contribution of 3D showings dropped in 2017 to 12 percent of the U.S. and Canada\u2019s $11.1 billion total take, its lowest point essentially since 3D movies became a thing.The numbers come straight from the horse\u2019s mouth: an MPAA report (PDF) on ticket sales. It\u2019s a mixed bag altogether, for the most part positive: people are still watching lots of movies, and they\u2019re paying to go to theaters all over the world. Global box office hit a new record ($40.6 billion) even if the U.S. and Canada dropped 2 percent.The decline of 3D, however, is really only noted in the following chart:You can see that at 12 percent of total box office, it\u2019s the lowest percentage and absolute amount of ticket sales for 3D movies since 2009. The peak, in 2010, was largely due to Avatar, surely the most impressive 3D film and certainly the highest grossing, even if it did use Papyrus for its title font. It\u2019s been largely downhill since then.And why not? 3D is expensive, uncomfortable, degrades the quality of the picture, rarely adds anything to a film and, in fact, is often bolted on after the fact in post-production. (CG films, more easily converted and aimed at a younger crowd, are an exception.)3D TVs failed, 3D gaming failed, VR\u2019s special take on 3D is at the very least failing to succeed \u2014 so why not 3D film?As an embellishment on moviemaking, it\u2019s largely bankrupt of possibility, but the idea of creating a \u201cpremium\u201d tier of moviegoing (the sort-of-stealth motive of 3D) is far from a bad idea. People will pay extra for things like big seats, 21+ showings where you can drink, good food and so on. And as MoviePass has shown, they\u2019ll also pay for theaters as a service \u2014 although whether the company can pull that off at the current price point is a matter of some debate.Even if Avatar 2 were to give the 3D box office a shot in the arm, it\u2019s unlikely that the enterprise is considered worth saving when other, fresher opportunities to put butts in seats are in the offing. Here\u2019s hoping 2018 or 2019 will be the last time you have to specify 2D when buying tickets.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/3d-movie-box-office-totals-take-another-dive/"},

{"title": ["Facebook retracted Zuckerberg\u2019s messages from recipients\u2019 inboxes"], "text": "You can\u2019t remove Facebook messages from the inboxes of people you sent them to, but Facebook  did that for Mark Zuckerberg and other executives. Three sources confirm to TechCrunch that old Facebook messages they received from Zuckerberg have disappeared from their Facebook inboxes, while their own replies to him conspicuously remain. An email receipt of a Facebook message from 2010 reviewed by TechCrunch proves Zuckerberg sent people messages that no longer appear in their Facebook chat logs or in the files available from Facebook\u2019s Download Your Information tool.When asked by TechCrunch about the situation, Facebook claimed in\u00a0this statement it was done for corporate security:However, Facebook never publicly disclosed the removal of messages from users\u2019 inboxes, nor privately informed the recipients. That raises the question of whether this was a breach of user trust. When asked that question directly over Messenger, Zuckerberg declined to provide a statement.A Facebook spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that users can only delete messages from their own inboxes, and that they would still show up in the recipient\u2019s thread. There appears to be no \u201cretention period\u201d for normal users\u2019 messages, as my inbox shows messages from as early as 2005. That indicates Zuckerberg and other executives received special treatment in being able to pull back previously sent messages.[Update 4/6/2018: Facebook now says that it plans to launch an \u201cunsend\u201d feature for Facebook messages to all users in the next several months, and won\u2019t let Mark Zuckerberg use that feature any more until it launches for everyone. One option Facebook is considering for the Unsend feature is an expiration timer users could set. But it\u2019s alarming that Facebook didn\u2019t disclose the retractions or plans for a Unsend button until forced, and scrambling to give everyone the feature seems like an effort to quiet users\u2019 anger over the situation.]Facebook chats sent by Zuckerberg from several years ago or older were missing from the inboxes of both former employees and non-employees. What\u2019s left makes it look like the recipients were talking to themselves, as only their side of back-and-forth conversations with Zuckerberg still appear. Three sources asked to remain anonymous out of fear of angering Zuckerberg or burning bridges with the company.[Update: Recent messages from Zuckerberg remain in users\u2019 inboxes. Old messages from before 2014 still appear to some users, indicating the retraction did not apply to all chats the CEO sent. But more sources have come forward since publication, saying theirs disappeared, as well.]None of Facebook\u2019s terms of service\u00a0appear to give it the right to remove content from users\u2019 accounts unless it violates the company\u2019s community standards. While it\u2019s somewhat standard for corporations to have data retention policies that see them delete emails or other messages from their own accounts that were sent by employees, they typically can\u2019t remove the messages from the accounts of recipients outside the company. It\u2019s rare that these companies own the communication channel itself and therefore host both sides of messages as Facebook does in this case, which potentially warrants a different course of action with more transparency than quietly retracting the messages.Facebook\u2019s power to tamper with users\u2019 private message threads could alarm some. The issue is amplified by the fact that Facebook Messenger now has 1.3 billion users, making it one of the most popular communication utilities in the world.Zuckerberg is known to have a team that helps him run his Facebook profile, with some special abilities for managing his 105 million followers and constant requests for his attention. For example, Zuckerberg\u2019s profile doesn\u2019t show a button to add him as a friend on desktop, and the button is grayed out and disabled on mobile. But the ability to change the messaging inboxes of other users is far more concerning.Facebook may have sought to prevent leaks of sensitive corporate communications. Following the Sony hack, emails of Sony\u2019s president Michael Lynton, who sat on Snap Inc.\u2019s board, were exposed, revealing secret acquisitions and strategy.However, Facebook also may have looked to thwart the publication of potentially embarrassing personal messages sent by Zuckerberg or other executives. In\u00a02010,\u00a0Silicon Alley Insider\u00a0aka Business Insider published now-infamous instant messages from a 19-year-old Zuckerberg to a friend shortly after starting The Facebook in 2004. \u201cyea so if you ever need info about anyone at harvard . . .\u00a0just ask . . .\u00a0i have over 4000 emails, pictures, addresses, sns\u201d Zuckerberg wrote to a friend. \u201cwhat!? how\u2019d you manage that one?\u201d they asked. \u201cpeople just submitted it . .\u00a0\u00a0i don\u2019t know why . . . they \u2018trust me\u2019 . . . dumb fucks\u201d Zuckerberg explained.The New Yorker later confirmed the messages with Zuckerberg, who told the publication he \u201cabsolutely\u201d regretted them. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to go on to build a service that is influential and that a lot of people rely on, then you need to be mature, right? I think I\u2019ve grown and learned a lot,\u201d said Zuckerberg.If the goal of Facebook\u2019s security team was to keep a hacker from accessing the accounts of executives and therefore all of their messages, they could have merely been deleted on their side the way any Facebook user is free to do, without them disappearing from the various recipients\u2019 inboxes. If Facebook believed it needed to remove the messages entirely from its servers in case the company\u2019s backend systems we breached, a disclosure of some kind seems reasonable.Now as Facebook encounters increased scrutiny regarding how it treats users\u2019 data in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the retractions could become a bigger issue. Zuckerberg is slated to speak in front of the U.S. Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees on April 10, as well as the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11. They could request more information about Facebook removing messages or other data from users\u2019 accounts without their consent. While Facebook is trying to convey that it understands its responsibilities, the black mark left on public opinion by past behavior may prove permanent.If you have more info on this situation, including evidence of messages from other Facebook executives disappearing, please contact this article\u2019s author, Josh Constine, via open Twitter DMs, josh@techcrunch.com, or encrypted Signal chat at (585)750-5674.For more on Facebook\u2019s recent troubles, read our feature pieces:\u00a0", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/zuckerberg-deleted-messages/"},

It\u00a0beat the goal, reaching the $20 billion mark far ahead of the calendar-equivalent date of mid-Summer of this year.One of those products, Teams, is a component to Office 365 and part of what\u00a0Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella called\u00a0a \u201cgrowth opportunity\u201d that is \u201ca lot bigger than anything [his company has] achieved.\u201dToday we\u2019re going to explore Microsoft\u2019s current actions in one part of the cloud productivity space through the lens of Teams.Microsoft\u2019s Teams product is a communications tool often compared to Slack . TechCrunch, for example, recently called the software service \u201cMicrosoft\u2019s Slack competitor.\u201d\u00a0ComputerWorld, in a news item earlier this year,\u00a0wrote that\u00a0\u201cMicrosoft turn[ed] up [the] heat on Slack\u201d when it announced new Teams features.It goes on and on, allowing us to comfortably hold up Microsoft Teams as Redmond\u2019s answer to Slack, a company famous for its quick growth, impressive mind share and its independent status from any major tech company. That last fact remains true despite\u00a0rumored acquisition interest from Microsoft itself, along with\u00a0pretty much every big company in the sector you can name.To see Microsoft invest in its own tool that competes with Slack isn\u2019t surprising. There is a large market for the product, and Redmond is loath to let any rival service cut in on its productivity revenue.Therefore, if there is a hot productivity tool in the market and Microsoft isn\u2019t going to buy it, it might as well build one of its own. Unsurprisingly, the company has been hard at work doing just that.News that Teams could release a free version\u00a0made headlines. Teams also\u00a0picked up guest access in February, its introduction of Cortana integration\u00a0made it into mainstream tech publications and this week Microsoft announced new \u201cretention policies\u201d for Teams.All that and Microsoft\u00a0bought Teams a friend\u00a0this year in the form of\u00a0Chalkup, a collaboration company focused on the education world.In short, Teams is adding new features while building its org chart and expanding access. All good things, certainly. However, it was not too long ago Microsoft spent quite a lot of money to buy a different, distinct collaboration tool. What happened to it?Microsoft bought Yammer  in 2012 for $1.2 billion, building out what TechCrunch\u00a0called, at the time, its\u00a0\u201cSocial Enterprise Strategy.\u201d And while the Yammer-Microsoft deal was \u201cgreat news\u201d for the company and its investors, it also marked the beginning of the \u201ctough part\u201d for the newly acquired startup.Joining a big company when you are a comparatively small company can be arduous. And if you do so when the larger company is undergoing a massive change in leadership (Microsoft hired a new CEO two years after the Yammer deal) and a business model change-up (Microsoft bought Nokia in 2014, also two years after the Yammer deal, before closing that strategic idea out years later), it\u2019s probably even harder to integrate.Externally, that difficulty showed. Following the Microsoft deal, Yammer\u00a0search volume grew before stagnating and later slipping. The product was eventually switched on for free for Office 365 customers in early 2016, four years after it was purchased. Office 365 itself launched a\u00a0half-decade before, making the moment a bit long in the works.But all that is the past, and, notably, Microsoft is putting more emphasis on Yammer today than it has in recent years. That may feel odd, given what we just went over concerning Teams.To dig into that,\u00a0Crunchbase News\u00a0got Microsoft\u2019s Seth Patton on the phone, who explained the company\u2019s thinking. According to the 15-year company veteran who now works on Office 365, Microsoft has two separate views for Teams and Yammer. Teams is built for what Patton calls inner-loop communication: stuff for teams, smaller companies and the like; Yammer, in contrast, is better for outer-loop communication: less tactical decisions and more company-wide communications.The split between Slack and Teams products and the Yammers and Convos of the world isn\u2019t hokum or mere corporate-speak. I\u2019ve worked in newsrooms that used the mix of tools to allow for simple direct messaging between individuals (Slack) and team-wide threaded communications (Yammer). It takes a little getting used to, but it can flow well if you need that level of inter-party discussion.Even more interesting than the fact that Yammer is not dead is that Microsoft is actively investing in it. According to Patton, Microsoft\u2019s chiefs \u201cdoubled down\u201d on Yammer while Teams was being brought\u00a0into the market\u00a0in late 2016. This gave Yammer about a year of redoubled investment and attention.Taking all that together, Microsoft is investing in two communications products at the same time, both of which are baked into its productivity suite. So why the huge push now?You are no doubt familiar with Slack\u2019s growth arc. It\u2019s been a nearly chronic narrative in tech for the past few years. And I don\u2019t mean that in a pejorative sense. (I\u2019m as guilty as anyone else.)But, in case you have a life, here are some highlights: Slack reached ARR of $50 million\u00a0in December of 2015. In October of 2016, Slack hit\u00a0the $100 million ARR mark. Then the company bested $200 million\u00a0last September. That\u2019s darn quick, and investors took notice,\u00a0showering the company with cash\u00a0and ever-rising valuations.Fueling Slack\u2019s continued growth is a push into the realm of bigger companies. The firm launched Slack Enterprise Grid last January, bringing enterprise-grade management tools to Slack\u2019s product. With Enterprise Grid, Slack can keep going after bigger accounts. (To that point, IBM has more than 200,000 active users on Slack that use Enterprise Grid.)That quick growth has made Slack an acquisition target. One way to get acquired, after all, is to stick out by worrying the biggest companies in the market through growth. It\u2019s just hard as heck to do, as incumbent revenue numbers are so large that, well, you have to grow fast to become interesting.As we know, Slack has rebuffed acquisition offers. As a result, we\u2019re seeing Microsoft, the dominant player in the world of productivity, attempt to slow down Slack in an effort to not lose future users and future dollars. Hell, even Google is in on the race. Its\u00a0Slack competitor launched\u00a0for early users in February. Facebook is also tinkering around the edges. It\u2019s\u00a0fun to watch.But productivity is Microsoft\u2019s cash cow. For Google, it\u2019s a big side project, but nothing compared to its advertising revenue. That puts Microsoft and Slack more up against one another in the enterprise chat fight.(In mid-March, Microsoft announced that 200,000 organizations now use Teams, up from 125,000 in September of 2017. That\u2019s 60 percent growth in a half-year or so \u2014 a quick growth pace, too.)What we\u2019ll learn over the next few years is if Microsoft\u2019s enormous enterprise channel can be leveraged enough to slow Slack\u2019s growth, or if Slack\u2019s momentum can actually capture a piece of the productivity market and hold onto it.It\u2019s a startup against a platform company, a classic enough battle. But with big tech bigger, richer and more powerful than ever, it\u2019s a more relevant business case than we might think at first blush. More when one draws blood or Slack goes public.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-08 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/08/in-a-slack-world-microsoft-bets-on-teams-and-yammer/"},

Though that claim is questionable, online marketers know display ads and even sponsored content are no longer enough to attract twentysomethings. PlayingViral gives brands a new way to lure young consumers with embeddable surveys and quizzes that use machine-learning algorithms to reach the right audiences.The second Indonesian company accepted into Y Combinator (after bill payment platform Payfazz), PlayingViral  finished the accelerator program last month and is now getting ready to expand in the United States, Canada, Brazil and other markets.PlayingViral is part of Nusantara Technology, a tech and media group that develops marketing tools for clients, including Proctor & Gamble, that want to reach young Indonesians. So far, the company has received investment from former Sequoia Capital partner Yinglan Tan through his new firm Insignia Ventures, former Indonesian Minister of Trade Mari Elka Pangestu and Y Combinator.Both Nusantara and PlayingViral were founded by chief executive officer Steven Wongsoredjo and chief product officer Michael Rendy.\u00a0About a year after launching Nusantara in 2016, the team began to realize that \u201cthe online media business has the potential to go big, but it\u2019s hard to scale because it lacks a human touch,\u201d Wongsoredjo told TechCrunch. PlayingViral was created to fix that problem.PlayingViral\u2019s personalized, interactive content is intended to attract users who are jaded by banner ads. For example, a property developer used PlayingViral to create a survey that tells users what kind of house they can afford based on their income level and location. Other customers have embedded quizzes that reward players with discount codes. There are hundreds of dialects spoken in Indonesia and PlayingViral relies on its machine-learning algorithms to adapt content to different languages and decide where they should be placed in Nusantara\u2019s online media network. It also analyzes what keywords, graphics and colors get the most engagement, helping brands refine their marketing strategies.An example of PlayingViral\u2019s interactive content is embedded below, while demos on PlayingViral\u2019s site show its other uses, including text message stories and Mad Libs-style quizzes.\u00a0Wongsoredjo says PlayingViral became profitable just two months after it launched in January. Clients include Singapore Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Nokia.\u00a0Its biggest competitor is SurveyMonkey, but PlayingViral differentiates by focusing on more informal and shorter surveys. Of course, other companies are also developing interactive embeddable content, but Wongsoredjo says PlayingViral and Nusantara plan to future-proof themselves by building more comprehensive data sets about what captures millennials\u2019 attention than their competitors.\u201cIf someone wants to copy us, they have to do a lot of experimenting,\u201d says Wongsoredjo.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-05 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/05/playingviral-helps-marketers-grabs-millennials-attention-with-quick-interactive-surveys/"},

This appears to be the motive for this incident,\u201d said San Bruno Police Chief Ed Barberini at a press conference Wednesday morning.The police identified\u00a0Nasim Najafi Aghdam, a San Diego resident, as the shooter; police said they believed she acted alone. Her family reported her missing on March 31.Aghdam was a regular and outspoken YouTube user and had posted dozens of videos on various topics and in several languages. Her personal website and videos make it clear she believed the company deliberately limited the reach of some users, including herself.The suspect also had videos on other sites, including one called \u201cDiscrimination Filteration On Youtube\u201d (sic) on vid.me, and the site includes images of her YouTube dashboard showing declines in views over the course of 2016.Specifically Aghdam appears to have been concerned that she was being discriminated against for her veganism, a practice about which she felt very strongly, not on the basis of (for example) her race, gender or other traits. She asserted that one video had been age-restricted by an anti-vegan YouTube employee, and that subsequently the company \u201cbegan filtering my videos to reduce views & revenue to suppress me!\u201dHow this frustration with YouTube\u2019s policies grew into the choice to commit yesterday\u2019s attack is not clear and police did not speculate; the investigation is just starting. The San Bruno police department also did not elaborate on what prior contact\u00a0Aghdam may have had with the Mountain View police department that same day, in a question from a reporter on the scene.Update: A Mountain View police representative told the Mercury News that they had encountered Aghdam sleeping in a car earlier that day. \u201cOur officers made contact with the woman after the license plate of her vehicle matched that of a missing person out of Southern California. The woman confirmed her identity to us and answered subsequent questions. At the conclusion of our discussion, her family was notified that she had been located.\u201dThe suspect reportedly accessed the YouTube building through the parking garage, from which she entered the courtyard and began firing indiscriminately. She struck three people before turning the firearm, a licensed and registered 9mm handgun, on herself.\u201cAt this point we have no indication that she was selecting individuals to fire on,\u201d Barberini said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no link or relationship that we\u2019ve identified between our suspect and anybody who was at the scene at the time of the incident. We know that she was upset with YouTube; whether that rises to the level of terrorism will hopefully be determined in the coming weeks.\u201dHe also praised YouTube and its employees for their quick response:\u201cYouTube\u2019s response to this critical incident was also extraordinary. They were extremely prepared to offer services to all of their employees in a swift and timely manner. This would have been much more challenging for us without all of their assistance.\u201dThe company had worked with police specifically on policies and measures for dealing with an active shooter.

In addition to normal touch gestures, iOS could detect when you hover your finger over the screen to trigger some actions.When Steve Jobs introduced the first iPhone, he spent quite a bit of time demonstrating the multitouch interface. You could touch the screen with your finger without applying any pressure, which was already something new back then. You could also swipe your finger on the screen, use multiple fingers in order to pinch to zoom or rotate a photo.Starting with the iPhone 6S, Apple also introduced another gesture with 3D Touch. By applying some pressure on the screen, you can preview a photo or an email, open a shortcut menu and more. The iPhone detects multiple levels of pressure so that you can first preview and then open a document.According to Bloomberg, upcoming iPhones could also detect touchless gestures right above the display. It\u2019s unclear how Apple plans to use those new gestures when it comes to software implementation. This feature won\u2019t be ready for this year\u2019s new iPhones.Bloomberg also says that Apple has been experimenting with curved iPhones.

{"title": ["Google\u2019s latest undersea cable project will connect Japan to Australia"], "text": "When you\u2019re a company as large as Google,  you need to make build versus buy decisions every day, whether that\u2019s buying a company or building the software or renting time on an undersea cable or building your own. Today, the company announced that it\u2019s decided to build another undersea cable. This one will run from Japan to Guam and from Guam to Australia.That\u2019s a lot of territory, approximately 9,500 KM or almost 6000 miles, and it\u2019s a major undertaking. The company doesn\u2019t take a project of this scope lightly, but they felt that it was in their best interest from an economic and technical perspective. The cable has been dubbed JGA and will connect up with the existing Hong Kong-Singapore-Australia cable to build a ring that covers the Asia-Pacific region.\u201cJGA is being co-built by NEC Corporation and Alcatel Submarine Networks. The JGA-South segment is being developed by a consortium of AARnet, Google, and RTI-C, while the JGA-North segment is a private cable being developed by RTI-C,\u201d according to a blog post on the published on the project today.The decision to build the cable came down to an economic decision related to the sheer scale of Google usage, says Vijay Vusirikala, principal engineer at Google, whose specialty involves undersea cables. It becomes much more cost-effective to build their own cables than it does to rent time on somebody else\u2019s when you reach a certain usage level. \u201cThis is essentially building infrastructure at scale and with scale getting the optimization benefits,\u201d Vusirikala explained.\u201cWe have been using existing cables to connect to the different parts of the region. This announcement is part of the series of investments [we are making] to get us to scale and improve economics, he added.Today\u2019s announcement is really just the beginning of a project that could take well into next year to complete. It starts with building the cables in factories. The cables are built to last and withstand the conditions of lying in an ocean bed. Each cable contains fibre cables made of extremely high quality glass that can carry 100 terabits of traffic. To put that in perspective, Google says this is equal to 63,000 photos per second, or more than 650,000 simultaneous HD video streams.While that\u2019s going on a team of experts will map out the optimal routes for the cable to have the least amount of latency, while taking into account the easiest way to lay the cable. It\u2019s a balancing act.Eventually they put the cable on big spools, put the spools on ships and lay the cable in the sea bed. Each cable has a repeater ever 80 KM that pushes the signal further on its journey down the cable.Michael\u00a0Francois from Google\u2019s Global Network Infrastructure team says these cables are built to last, but they can break occasionally. \u201cThey\u00a0generally don\u2019t fail once they are put in. They are [designed] to sit there a long time. Generally when something happens \u2014 it could be dropping an anchor on it and\u00a0breaking through armoring of the cable.\u00a0If it does break, it needs to be repaired by ship,\u201d he said.The project is part of a network of 300 cables worldwide. There has been an uptick in the number the last couple of years as cloud providers and hyper scalers like Facebook, Amazon and others require more connectivity across regions.__This video explains how the cable makes it from factory to sea bed.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/googles-latest-undersea-cable-project-will-connect-japan-to-australia/"},

{"title": ["Sarah Lacy launches Chairman Mom, a social platform for working mothers"], "text": "Sarah Lacy,  founder of media site Pando, has unveiled her newest company, Chairman Mom. The subscription-based startup aims to provide resources to working mothers, and ultimately set them up to succeed in all areas of their lives.\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s actually pretty distinct for us is we focus really on the woman, not the children,\u201d Lacy told TechCrunch. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sites where you can get a lot of answers of what\u2019s a great pre-school or where\u2019s a restaurant that is kid-friendly. and a lot of things are always very kid-centric. We\u2019re really woman centric.\u201dAt launch, Chairman Mom is focused on one key functionality: a question and answer platform. Every day, Chairman Mom\u2019s team of three curates two questions \u2014 one about life and one about work \u2014 from the community to feature on the site for answers and discussion. These questions can range from \u201cHow much do you get paid?\u201d to \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to handle harassment at work?\u201d to \u201cWhat should I do if I think my spouse is cheating on me?\u201d\u201cThe goal of each thread is to get that mom the best answer,\u201d Lacy said. \u201cIt\u2019s really not to have an open discussion board of everyone\u2019s views on that topic.\u201dWhat makes Chairman Mom different from the likes of other social media sites is its emphasis on using real names while also offering anonymity. Real names are required to sign up but community members can ask and respond to questions anonymously. There is also no up-voting or direct messaging.\u201cWe don\u2019t have things that have created tribalism and fights on other mom networks,\u201d Lacy said.The goal with Chairman Mom is to rebrand what working mothers and what working motherhood represents, Lacy said. Before Lacy first became a mother, she heard horror stories about what to expect, she said. Some people, for example, told her to expect to feel like a failure at home and at work. But that\u2019s not what it was like for her, Lacy said.\u201cI was shocked at the disconnect between that and what happened when I actually had kids,\u201d Lacy said. What happened when I had kids was I became better at everything. I became more ambitious, I wrote more quickly, I was so much better as a manager. I was so much more productive. You really have this amazing ability to prioritize what\u2019s important.\u201dLacy went with the name Chairman Mom to \u201ctelegraph in charge and maternal,\u201d she said. It was important to her, she said, for the name not to conjure up any connotations of shame around pregnancy and motherhood.\u201cIt\u2019s even a step beyond \u2018I\u2019m not ashamed,\u2019 but like \u2018No, this is our source of power,'\u201d she said. \u201cSomething that just sounds so declaratively in charge but also maternal. And it\u2019s still called the chairman of the board. And it\u2019s this idea of we\u2019re overthrowing a patriarchy. This is a man\u2019s world that we\u2019re overthrowing and we don\u2019t have any illusion about that fact.\u201dChairman Mom costs $5 per month for access to its community of honest answers to questions about working motherhood. By having people pay to access the platform, one hope is that trolls won\u2019t pay actual money to troll, Lacy said.

{"title": ["Facebook to exclude North American users from some privacy enhancements"], "text": "There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat this message: Facebook\u2019s  founder Mark Zuckerberg believes North America users of his platform deserve a lower data protection standard than people everywhere else in the world.In a phone interview with Reuters\u00a0yesterday Mark Zuckerberg declined to commit to universally implementing changes to the platform that are necessary to comply with the European Union\u2019s incoming General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Rather, he said the company was working on a version of the law that would bring some European privacy guarantees worldwide \u2014 declining to specify to the reporter which parts of the law would not extend worldwide.\u201cWe\u2019re still nailing down details on this, but it should directionally be, in spirit, the whole thing,\u201d\u00a0 Reuters quotes Zuckerberg on the GDPR question.This is a subtle shift of line. Facebook\u2019s leadership has previously implied the product changes it\u2019s making to comply with GDPR\u2019s incoming data protection standard would be extended globally.Back in January, COO Sheryl Sandberg said the company would be rolling out \u201ca new privacy center globally\u201d \u2014 putting \u201cthe core privacy settings for Facebook in one place and make it much easier for people to manage their data\u201d.A spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch today that the changes it revealed\u00a0late last month \u2014 including finally reducing its historical settings sprawl from 20 screens to just one \u2014 were what Sandberg was talking about in those earlier comments. Ergo, even those basic tweaks are a direct result of the EU regulation.However that universal privacy center looks to be just one portion of the changes Facebook needs to make to comply with the new EU standard. And not all these changes are going to be made available to US and Canadian Facebook users \u2014 per Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks.In a blog about the new privacy center late last month, Facebook flagged additional incoming changes to its terms of service \u2014 including \u201ccommitments\u201d to users, and the language it uses to explain how it\u2019s processing people\u2019s data.It said these incoming changes would be \u201cabout transparency\u201d.And indeed transparency is a key underlying principle of GDPR, which places requirements on data controllers to clearly explain to people what personal data they intend to collect and for what exact purpose \u2014 in order to gain informed consent for processing the data (or, if not consent, another valid basis is required for the data processing to be legal).What\u2019s less clear is exactly which portions of GDPR Facebook believes it can safely separate out for users on its platform and not risk accidentally mishandling the personal data of an international user \u2014 say who might be visiting or living in the US \u2014 thereby running the risk of privacy complaints and, ultimately, financial sanctions (penalties for violations can be very large under GDPR).Facebook did not respond to additional questions about its GDPR compliance intentions so we can but speculate at this stage.It\u2019s even just a risky strategy in pure PR terms. As we wrote in January\u00a0in our GDPR explainer: \u201c[S]ome US companies might prefer to swallow the hassle and expense of fragmenting their data handling processes\u2026 But doing so means managing multiple data regimes. And at very least runs the risk of bad PR if you\u2019re outed as deliberately offering a lower privacy standard to your home users vs customers abroad.\u201dSafe to say, the calls for equal application of GDPR in the US have started already\u2026On the speculation front, consent under GDPR for processing personal data means\u00a0offering individuals \u201cgenuine choice and control\u201d, as the UK\u2019s data watchdog explains it. So perhaps Facebook isn\u2019t comfortable about giving North American users that kind of autonomy to revoke specific consents at will.Or maybe Zuckerberg is unwilling to let Americans ask for their personal data in an adequately portable form \u2014 so they could go and plug it into a rival service. (Though it does already let users download their data.)Or it could be that Facebook isn\u2019t comfortable with what GDPR has to say about profiling \u2014 which is, after all, the core of the company\u2019s ad targeting business model.The regulation\u2019s transparency requirements do extend to profiling \u2014 meaning\u00a0Facebook will need to inform (at least its international) users they are being profiled when they use the platform, and explain what it means for them.So perhaps Zuckerberg thinks Americans might balk if they really understood how pervasively it tracks them when it has to explain exactly what it\u2019s doing \u2014 as indeed\u00a0some Facebook users did\u00a0recently, when they found out Messenger had been logging their call and SMS metadata, for example.The EU regulation also places some restrictions on the practice of using data to profile individuals if the data is sensitive data \u2014 such as health data, political belief, religious affiliation and so on \u2014 requiring an even higher standard of explicit consent for doing so.And of course, with the Cambridge Analytica data misuse scandal, we\u2019ve seen how massive amounts of Facebook data were expressly used\u00a0to try to infer US voters\u2019 political beliefs.Let\u2019s not forget that Facebook itself ploughs its own resources into engaging politicians to use its platform for campaigning too. So perhaps it\u2019s worried it might risk losing this chunk of elite business in the US if American Facebook users have to give explicit consent to their political leanings being\u00a0fair game for ad targeting purposes. (And when many people would probably say \u2018no thanks Mark; that\u2019s none of your business\u2019.)But, as I say, we can but speculate what kind of GDPR carve outs Zuckerberg has planned for users on his home turf at this stage. The regulation comes into force on May 25 \u2014 so Facebookers don\u2019t have long to wait to play a game of \u2018spot the privacy standard discrepancy\u2019.What\u2019s most curious about the Facebook founder demurring on a universal application of GDPR is the timing of it \u2014 in the midst of arguably the company\u2019s biggest ever privacy scandal.At a point when consumer groups are calling for new rules to control social media\u2019s excesses and lawmakers are increasingly willing to listen. \u201cFacebook will gather, analyze and monetize more data from US and other countries outside the GDPR,\u201d Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told us, giving his reaction to Zuckerberg\u2019s comments. \u201cThere will be a ongoing weakening of consumer data protection rights as a consequence. NGOs intend to press Facebook, Google and others to adopt any GDPR changes worldwide.\u201dSo if Zuckerberg feels North Americans\u2019 privacy can be handled as a backburner consideration even now, by revealing he plans to work really hard to make sure domestic Facebook users are given second tier privacy status below everyone else in the rest of the world, well, you have to question the authenticity of his recent apology for the \u201cmistakes\u201d that he claimed led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Facebook was actually warned over app permissions in 2011, as we\u2019ve reported before. Yet it did not shut down the developer access that was used to pass personal data on 50M+ Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica until mid 2015. So, frankly, if that was a mistake, it was a very, very, slow moving one.Some might say it looks rather more like reluctance to comply with data protection standards.Here\u2019s one of the core architects of GDPR \u2014 European MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht \u2014 asking the key question now: How long will consumers in North America take being put in privacy coach class?

The firm\u00a0recently raised $1.6 billion\u00a0(supposedly) for the new business and it began recruiting delivery drivers in Wuxi early last month, according to our Chinese partner site Technode.Luo Wen, who heads\u00a0up the new Didi service, said the company plans complete the Wuxi trial \u201cas swiftly as possible\u201d in order to launch the food delivery platform more widely. \u201cWe are looking to expand the service to more cities in the near term,\u201d he added.Still, it\u2019s a surprise that it has taken the five-year-old company this long to get into food delivery.Uber Eats went on a major global expansion last year, while regional competitors Ola, Grab and Go-Jek all entered the space some time ago. Yet Didi, a big dog with its $56 billion valuation and investments across five continents, is only just dipping its toes in now.Right now the timing seems particularly apt given that China\u2019s largest food delivery service is actively taking on Didi\u2019s core business. Meituan Dianping, a $30 billion-valued startup, launched ride-hailing services over the past six months and this week it scooped up Mobike,  one of China\u2019s top two bike-sharing companies, in a $2.7 billion deal.

{"title": ["Some data science on the newly released Trump and China tariffs"], "text": "War! The Trump administration announced late last night its next daring attack on China\u2019s unfair trade practices, and it has gone straight for the jugular, announcing that it is putting tariffs on about 1330 goods including \u201cParts for air conditioning machines\u201d and \u201cBakery ovens, including biscuit ovens.\u201dIncluding biscuit ovens! Without the heat emanating from our precious biscuit ovens, we will be able to avoid using air conditioning when all the A/C parts run out. Brilliant.There\u2019s even more heat packed into these tariffs though, since Chinese-made flamethrowers were included on the list. No word yet on whether Elon Musk\u2019s Boring Company not a flamethrower flamethrower will be counted as a flamethrower (or made in China for that matter).Of course, the Chinese have responded with their own new tariffs list (a list different from the new tariffs the country announced on Monday). The new new tariffs includes soy, cars, and other goods from America.Okay, I admit it: tariffs are really boring. The tit-for-tat attacks are like a really boring game of Battleship. Actually, that\u2019s redundant \u2014 it\u2019s just a game of Battleship, so I am going to try to spice things up with some data science.The modern economy is complicated. What exactly is a \u201cbiscuit oven\u201d anyway? How does the government know when to apply a tariff to a good and when not to? To solve these dilemmas, the U.S. government invented a mechanism called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule which has categories for every product in the world organized into chapters numbered 1 through 99.Some chapters, like chapter 86 (\u201cRailway or tramway locomotives, rolling-stock and parts thereof; [blah blah blah]\u201d) have only a couple of dozen categories, while chapter 84 (\u201cNuclear reactors, boilers, machinery and mechanical appliances; parts thereof,\u201d i.e. the cool stuff) has by my count more than 2000 categories.I wanted to look at the 1333 categories the Trump administration picked to understand what goods seemed to draw the most attention from the trade team. Unfortunately, the list of categories was released as a PDF (thanks government!), so I had to perform several conversions to get the raw data. The entire Harmonized Tariff Schedule is available in a machine-readable format through Data.gov.Using Python, I performed counts of the various HTS numbers to compare the number of categories available under the schedule with the number of categories that the Trump administration proposed for tariffs. This is a pretty rough analysis, since the categories are administrative and not economic (in other words, some categories could be worth billions of dollars while others are much less valuable). That said, this analysis can still give us a sense of where the administration focused on.Two categories were hit hard by the tariffs \u2013 Chapter 30 pharmaceuticals and Chapter 86 locomotive parts. Both had more than a third of their categories added to the tariffs list with China, far above the percentage of other categories. From there, precision equipment and machinery (Chapters 90 and 84 respectively) were hit, covering roughly a quarter of products each. My complete analysis list is included below.One hypothesis I would take from these tariffs is that they could actually be quite a bit more punitive than first meets the eye. While the tariffs are being applied to roughly $50 billion worth of goods, the goods appear to have been specifically chosen to encompass a range of parts and machines required in manufacturing.For instance, imagine that your \u201cInstrument panel clocks\u201d suddenly got more expensive, so you have to source clocks from a new vendor in another country. If you have to find new sources for enough parts, you might just consider adjusting your entire supply chain in the process, even for parts that didn\u2019t come under the new tariffs regime. It\u2019s this second-order economic effect that I think will be important to pay attention to.No one should read the Harmonized Tariffs Schedule, but these categories do matter for the economy, and companies are going to be racing to understand the decisions made by the administration and what it means for them. As typical with proposed rules, there is a public comment period, so expect heavy lobbying from companies to get certain items off the list (or even maybe on the list in order to drive away cheaper competitors).Ordered by percentage:", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/some-data-science-on-the-newly-released-trump-and-china-tariffs/"},
{"title": ["Is venture capital ready for companies with no founders?"], "text": "Initial coin offerings (ICOs) \u2014 a funding mechanism based on the technology behind cryptocurrencies like bitcoin \u2014 are a hot new way to launch a startup, and they\u2019re forcing investors to look at the startup process anew. Venture firms like mine understand that ICOs can reinvent how entrepreneurs bring innovations to life, but no one is quite sure how this will play out.The tech community is so perplexed by the swelling interest in ICOs, notable firms that traditionally compete to invest in the early stages of a company are trying to figure it out together, and often end up co-investing in the ICOs.Until recently, investors in Silicon Valley were obsessed with finding founders who have a great sense of purpose and a vision for a product or service. All the great companies have been driven by visionary founders, from Bill Hewlett and David Packard, to Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. So early-stage investors spend all their time looking for great founders and helping them build a company behind their instincts and leadership. This has been the model for 50 years.In many ways, that model has been beneficial to the economy. We\u2019ve built a lot of companies that have had an astounding impact on our lives and employed massive numbers of people. But the model has also created problems. The most formidable companies have accreted tremendous resources and power and are responsible for making profound decisions that affect whole industries and billions of people. Ultimately, all that power now lies in the judgment of a very few people \u2014 founders such as Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and Google\u2019s Larry Page.But all this could be about to change. Just like the origins of cryptocurrency were in deep dissatisfaction with hyper-scaled banks, initial coin offerings are in response in part to the lack of transparency and misalignment of interests between companies and consumers.ICOs won\u2019t just break traditional company models \u2014 they may also temper the concentration of power brought on by traditional company models. For instance, a company\u2019s ICO could be set up to encourage responsible innovation that benefits society, and ICO-backed collectives owned and operated by billions of people worldwide could challenge tech monopolies and spread wealth beyond the richest 1 percent.But first, we have to make ICOs work in an acceptable, repeatable way. Right now, the ICO frenzy seems like a whirlwind of experimentation, and none of the outcomes have had much commercial impact.ICOs are based on blockchain technology. A key component of blockchain is that it allows two entities (or people) to exchange value without a central authority (like a stock exchange or bank) executing the transaction. The transactions are tracked and carried out in software that runs on computers distributed all over the world. This mechanism is great for issuing a kind of software-based stock called tokens.These tokens can be embedded with software instructions that dictate the rules of that investment. A token doesn\u2019t have to be a passive share of a company like traditional stock. It might instead include a promise to deliver a service or product, which is similar to the way fundraising campaigns work on Kickstarter. Tokens can govern themselves and track every transaction, so no central stock exchange is necessary and no nation\u2019s government can easily regulate the instruments. An ICO company might, for instance, decide it will reveal financial information weekly \u2014 or annually, or never \u2014 depending on how management wants to run the company. Investors get to see those rules and decide whether they like the idea of investing in such a company. Unlike today\u2019s startups, an ICO can be a completely decentralized way of founding and running an enterprise. A person or collective could set up an ICO and program it with all the parameters that govern the entity \u2014 what it will do, how it will operate and so on \u2014 and start a company that builds itself. That\u2019s a more sophisticated version of how Wikipedia became the biggest encyclopedia on the planet: it set up rules for writing and editing, and then the community took over. Can this work in real life? Pavel Durov, the Russian founder of popular messaging app Telegram, got global press coverage for his $1.7 billion pre-ICO sale to create a cryptocurrency that would become a way for Telegram users to make payments anywhere in the world. But keep in mind that Durov is using his ICO to raise millions for a global project that so far has no product. If he\u2019s successful, the resulting cryptocurrency can become a platform for apps and financial transactions. But whatever this becomes, the rules embedded in the ICO will operate it \u2014 not Durov.Imagine services or applications built on blockchain that no company or person can dominate. A collective version of Facebook could make users and developers feel more in control, and less subject to Facebook\u2019s whims. You could set your own rules on how much privacy to give up, or how much you\u2019d get paid by every person who listens to the music you post. I\u2019m convinced that at some point, someone will set up a blockchain social network that gets all the rules right and becomes an attractive alternative to Facebook.As a long-time investor in startups, though, I have concerns about ICOs that I can\u2019t yet resolve. Getting consensus among a large group is harder and slower than a powerful leader issuing orders. Social good is wonderful, but it won\u2019t get anywhere unless the entity can execute and build great products and services \u2014 hard to do without a structure and dedicated staff.The decentralized nature of ICO enterprises seems to often lead to chaos. One company, Tezos, raised $232 million in a 2017 ICO,  but now seems to be falling apart. The founding team is fighting among themselves, the ICO participants can\u2019t get access to the tokens they bought and at least four class-action lawsuits have been filed, most charging Tezos with violating security laws and defrauding those who joined the ICO. Then again, some run-of-the-mill venture-backed startups end up in similar messes.I am keen to see early success with the ICO model because I believe it will benefit society. Entrepreneurs in small towns who have crazy ideas would typically find it impossible to even get a meeting with a top-tier VC. ICOs give them a way to get funded by a broader range of individual investors, and that should help spread wealth to more people in more places. Blockchain today, as many have said, seems a lot like the internet in the early 1990s, when the internet\u2019s rules were evolving and few people understood what it could be used for. Like the internet, blockchain is a free protocol on which all sorts of new products and services will ride. It\u2019s going to drive massive innovation, and as investors, it\u2019s our job to support that innovation and bring it to market. Now we have to figure out how to best do that.As I orient myself to ICO-based opportunities, I\u2019ve come to realize there are some important questions we have to ask of these new ICO ventures. Is there economic alignment between the company and its investors or token holders? Is the crypto-token model essential for the technology under consideration, or is someone just taking advantage of the cryptocurrency frenzy? Is an ICO raising the right amount of money \u2014 or raising a crazy amount of money that will never pay off? I also think it\u2019s more important than ever to ask if the ICO\u2019s rules are aligned with society\u2019s core values instead of with the motivations of a founder.And then, odd as it can seem, VCs need to retrain themselves to assess blockchain-based algorithms in the way we\u2019ve long assessed founders. After all, the next time we find ourselves considering an investment in a company that might change the world, we might be examining blockchain code and reading a governing white paper. There won\u2019t even be a founder to talk to.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/is-venture-capital-ready-for-companies-with-no-founders/"},

It happens a lot more often than you realise. In fact, it\u2019s quite often the case in Silicon Valley, despite the mythic status the \u2018founder story\u2019 has attained there in recent times. So it\u2019s actually a sign of maturity that founders in Europe are making moves of this nature.The most recent was George Bevis, founder of startup business bank Tide, who has decided he\u2019d rather find a CEO experienced at scaling a business after the initial startup phase. And today two more UK founders have decided to call it a day and move on.Alicia Navarro will today step down from the role of CEO of Skimlinks  \u2014 the commerce monetisation platform for content publishers \u2014 handing the reigns to Sebastien Blanc, currently Chief Revenue Officer. Sources say the move has been amicably approved by the Skimlinks board. Both Navarro, and  her co-founder Joe Stepniewski who was Chief Product & Strategy Officer, are to now leave the day to day running of the company, although Navarro will become \u201cPresident\u201d and maintain a role as \u201cfounding visionary, client and partner advocate, and board member.\u201d The company will also now go on the hunt for a Chairman.Under Navarro\u2019s leadership, Skimlinks raised $25 million in venture funding and built a monetisation platform that today includes over 57,000 publisher clients running Skimlinks technology on 4.5 million websites around the world, driving billions in e-commerce sales.Blanc brings a wealth of experience to the role. In a statement, Navarro said \u201che has a drive for excellence and a disciplined growth mindset that will take Skimlinks to the next level. As our Chief Revenue Officer for the past two years, Seb was instrumental in driving an acceleration in growth and efficiency that helped Skimlinks reach profitability. Skimlinks\u2019 culture is one of our most important assets. Seb\u2019s deep appreciation for our team, our customers, and our mission make him my natural choice to take over the responsibility of the company I started and led for ten years.\u201dBlanc has over 15 years experience in the media and advertising industry as an investor, advisor, and senior executive. Prior to joining Skimlinks, Blanc was a director at Quantcast, where he built and led the global media buying operations across five countries and signed the first 3,000 private deals with premium publishers. He joined Quantcast through their acquisition of the UK startup Struq, a programmatic advertising and retargeting specialist, where he launched the US operation and took revenues from $0 to $10 million in 18 months.Blanc said: \u201cOver the last two years, as CRO of Skimlinks, I have enjoyed working with Alicia and seeing her lead with a level of passion and dedication that only a founder can truly bring. She built a great business and a great team. I am looking forward to building upon what already makes us special, and finding new ways to deliver value for our customers and opportunities for growth to our people.\u201dHe told me: \u201cThe main plan is to continue the current strategy of encouraging large content publishers to increase the amount of commerce they do as part of revenue. The goal is to double down and give them better tools to do that. Big publishers have just started working on eCommerce revenue. But most publishers are making very low revenue per user. So \u201cservice journalism\u201d and \u201ccommerce journalism\u201d can become a real revenue source.\u201dJohn Brimacombe, Partner at Sussex Place Ventures and lead investor in Skimlinks\u2019 Series A, will assume the role of interim executive chairman while the company conducts a search for a permanent chairman. Brimacombe commented, \u201cAlicia is a model founder. Along with her co-founder Joe Stepniewski, Alicia took Skimlinks from an idea to more than $50 million in annual revenues. As the company now enters a new chapter of growth, Alicia made the bold decision to find a successor and guide the board through a thoughtful process to select a new CEO. I deeply respect and appreciate all that Alicia and Joe have done, and I\u2019m delighted to work with Seb in his role as CEO.\u201dJoe Krancki, Partner at Frog Capital commented: \u201cSince we led their Series C, Skimlinks has solidified its position as a lucrative partner to many of the world\u2019s best-known digital publishers, becoming the undisputed leader in the category they created for commerce-related content monetisation. We\u2019re thrilled to have Seb carry Alicia\u2019s vision forward as the new CEO of Skimlinks and continue transforming the way publishers earn revenue from their content.\u201dSo what will Navarro do now?She plans to help start and build other early-stage companies, mainly in an advisory role, and also public speaking.\u201cThis has not been an easy decision, as you would expect. I am incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve achieved as a team. However, my passion and talents lie in turning an idea into a thriving business,\u201d she says.

The company hired its first chief financial officer, Allen Shim, in February this year.Slack is one of those companies that faces a tense push-and-pull as it looks to get into larger and larger enterprises, which all have niche needs. The company is a darling in Silicon Valley thanks to its very simple interface, but with companies with thousands (or, eventually, tens of thousands of employees) just a tool with groups and direct messages could easily become unwieldy. That\u2019s why Slack has invested in a variety of tools, including rolling out threaded messaging a little more than a year ago. Slack is likely one of those companies that gets hundreds of feature requests a year for larger businesses that have niche use cases, but it still has to demonstrate that it\u2019s a simple product without hitting feature creep status.Underwood getting more authority over that evolution (of which she was already a huge part, including the development of threaded messages) is another signal that the company is looking to tap her consumer background at Twitter to create some kind of middle ground between feeling like a satisfying consumer product while still operating as an enterprise tool. Slack is increasingly looking to apply machine learning to help employees get to answers right away, and it still has to take the same kind of care in rolling out new features that satisfy the needs of larger organizations without sacrificing that simplicity that made it a darling in the first place.Slack most recently hit a $5.1 billion valuation in a recent investment round, and said it had around 6 million daily active users in September last year. That might be small-ish compared to the size and scale of Twitter, but as something geared toward internal communications at companies, that level of engagement in the workplace is going to increasingly be a selling point for the company as it looks to grow into that valuation.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/april-underwood-is-now-slacks-chief-product-officer/"},
{"title": ["Facebook rewrites Terms of Service, clarifying device data collection"], "text": "Facebook  is spelling out in plain English how it collects and uses your data in rewritten versions of its Terms of Service and Data Use Policy, though it\u2019s not asking for new rights to collect and use your data or changing any of your old privacy settings.The public has seven days to comment on the changes\u00a0(though Facebook doesn\u2019t promise to adapt or even respond to the feedback) before Facebook will ask all users to consent to the first set of new rules in three years.Unfortunately, because the changes to the language and structure of the terms are so wide-reaching and the new versions are so much longer, it\u2019s difficult to do a direct comparison of the differences between the old TOS and DUP\u00a0and the new versions embedded below.Perhaps the most interesting part of the expanded, plain-language terms are the specifics of how Facebook collects data from your devices. Conspiracy theories about it snooping on people through its microphone, and confusion about it collecting SMS and call log history likely pushed Facebook to give people details about what data it\u2019s slurping up.Facebook now explains that (emphasis mine):Specifically regarding SMS history and call logs, Facebook writes, \u201cWe also collect contact information if you choose to upload, sync or import it (such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like helping you and others find people you may know.\u201d Though Facebook asked users\u2019 permission for this data, nothing about SMS and call logs wasn\u2019t in the terms of service.Disappointingly, the new explanation of helping you find friends doesn\u2019t necessarily justify it collecting this data. Meanwhile, just today Facebook confirmed to Bloomberg that it does automatically scan all the text and image content of Messenger conversations to prevent violations of its Community Standards and the spread of spam or abuse. While other tech products like Google\u2019s Gmail scan the contents of your messages for advertising and other purposes, the revelation could scare some privacy-focused users away from Messenger.Facebook has also clarified how new products it\u2019s launched since the last TOS update \u2014 like Marketplace, fundraisers, Live, 360 and camera effects \u2014 work. It explains how every user\u2019s experience is personalized. A new Music Use Policy has been added as Facebook strikes deals with the major record labels.Finally, Facebook makes it clear that it, WhatsApp and Oculus (as well as Instagram) are all part of one company that it refers to as \u201cThe Facebook Companies.\u201d Instagram is now repeatedly mentioned in the TOS and DUP, whereas before it wasn\u2019t even mentioned. The recent #DeleteFacebook movement that missed Instagram indicated that many users don\u2019t quite realize they\u2019re part of the same corporation.As Facebook deals with a disgruntled public and awoken regulatory bodies, the rewriting of these policies might be perceived as the company trying to cover itself after neglecting to detail how it pulls and uses people\u2019s data. CEO Mark Zuckerberg might face questions about the changes and why they weren\u2019t in place before when he testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11th regarding protections of users\u2019 data privacy.But today\u2019s revamp could also give Facebook stronger documents to point to as it tries to prove it doesn\u2019t need heavy-handed government regulation. Switching from a more \u201clegalese\u201d document full of jargon to a more layman\u2019s version could also help it dispel myths or give people more transparency.If Facebook can give users a better understanding of how it works, it might be able to diffuse privacy scandals and backlashes before they happen.Facebook updated Terms Of Service \u2013 4/4/18 by Josh TechCrunch on ScribdFacebook updated Data Use Policy \u2013 4/4/18 by Josh TechCrunch on Scribd", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/facebook-terms-of-service/"},
{"title": ["Tinder begins testing its first video feature, Tinder Loops"], "text": "Tinder  is getting into video. On Wednesday, the popular dating app will begin testing its first video-based feature, Tinder Loops, with iOS users in Canada and Sweden. The company says it will evaluate how users respond to Loops before making a decision to roll it out to other markets.As you may have guessed by the name \u2013 \u201cLoops\u201d \u2013 the feature isn\u2019t focused on traditional video, but rather on a shorter, almost GIF-like looping video format that\u2019s been popularized by apps like Instagram\u2019s Boomerang and, before that, Twitter\u2019s Vine. In Tinder\u2019s case, Loops will be just two seconds long, and can be added to users\u2019 profiles alongside their photos.The company says it decided to test videos because it believes videos can show more of users\u2019 personalities, and that can increase people\u2019s chances of getting right-swiped (liked, that is). It suggests the videos could be used for showing off your favorite activities \u2013 like shooting hoops or cliff jumping. But it\u2019s likely that Tinder users will find other use cases for looping videos beyond that.Loops represents the next step in the evolution of our classic profile,\u201d said Brian Norgard, Chief Product Officer at Tinder. \u201cWith the addition of video, users have a new way to express themselves while also gaining key insights into the lives of potential matches. Whether it\u2019s dancing at a concert, doing cartwheels on the beach, or clinking glasses with friends, Loops makes profiles come alive. We anticipate Tinder Loops will lead to even more matches and conversations and look forward to seeing how our users creatively adopt the feature,\u201d he added.More realistically, looping videos may better show people as they are \u2013 not hidden behind a soft photo filter or snapped from a classic MySpace angle. And that could lead to less surprise on first dates, as people will have already gotten a better sense of who they\u2019re meeting, as well as how they like to have fun.But at only two-seconds long, Loops are not as intimidating as posting a \u201creal\u201d video for users who are more shy.To try the new feature, iOS users in the supported markets will be able to go to their profile, then tap the \u201cAdd Media\u201d button to upload a video. Once the video is selected, you can drag the time strip to select the part you want to loop, preview it, and post it to your profile.Tinder Loops currently supports only videos or Live Photos imported from your iOS Camera Roll. It doesn\u2019t allow users to capture Loops directly from the app.Alongside the option to add Loops, a subset of users in the test markets will also be given the ability to upload nine photos (or Loops), instead of just six. That could encourage more uploads of Loops as users won\u2019t have to remove their existing photos to give the feature a try.Tinder would not be the first dating app to dabble with video.Starting last year, a number of its rivals began to support video in various contexts, as well. Hinge started allowing users to add videos up to 30 seconds long to their profiles; Match and Bumble announced Stories-like features involving video (BumbleVID didn\u2019t pan out); and Zoosk tried video in a separate app, Lively, which has since pivoted to trivia. Integrating video, it appears, is not that easy.The feature\u2019s launch comes at a time when the competition between modern dating apps has been heating up. Specifically, Tinder and Bumble\u2019s battles have gotten nasty, with Tinder parent Match Group suing Bumble over patents, and Bumble suing Match Group back for fraudulently obtaining trade secrets. Tinder also recently said it would roll out a ladies-first option in its app, which is the thing Bumble is best known for.Now, with Loops, Tinder is differentiating itself further from the rest of the pack. Whether or not users will respond, however, remains to be seen.Loops is rolling out today to the supported test markets.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/tinder-begins-testing-its-first-video-feature-tinder-loops/"},
{"title": ["Millennials could be the answer to government malaise"], "text": "Millennials are on the move. And they\u2019re moving to cities. According to\u00a0CityLab,\u00a0the number of 25- to 34-year-olds will increase each year in the United States through 2024, rising from 44.1 million in 2015 to 47.6 million in 2024. This is the time of life when millennials are most likely to live in urban areas.Why does this matter?For those of us interested in the democratic health of our country, data and technology in cities, combined with the energy of millennials, offers an opportunity to reimagine city life. But it requires intentionality and looking beyond just coastal, affluent cities to making fundamental changes in governing that will transform the current perceptions of City Hall.Urban millennials live life on demand \u2014 their demand. From food delivery apps to live-streaming services, they increasingly expect instantaneous results and an opportunity for engagement. They also want to collaborate and share with one another. Whether it\u2019s their opinions or experiences, in our increasingly atomized lives, people are looking to technology for connection and participation. From Wikipedia to Waze and Yelp, digital tools are leveraging individuals\u2019 experiences for aggregate results.However, it is still an entirely different story when it comes to government. Residents feel like government\u2019s antiquated systems do not meet their expectations. In fact, it\u2019s even worse than that. American democracy is in crisis. Fewer than\u00a01 out of 3 people\u00a0find government credible. What does it take to tap into the energy, expertise and excitement of everyday residents and combine that with more entrepreneurial approaches to government?Millennials are changing notions about life, in part through technology and the\u00a0awakening of activism\u00a0following the 2016 election of Donald Trump. With this, there is an opportunity for cities to demonstrate that 1) data and evidence can make urban governance better, 2) City Hall is a dynamic place to work and engage with and 3) cities can tap into residents\u2019 creativity in new and unexpected ways. As the number of 25- to 34-year-old millennials will increase by about 3 million over the next seven years, there are\u00a0projections\u00a0that this is the exact time in life millennials are most likely to live in cities.But this needs to be a conversation that encompasses cities of all sizes and takes seriously concerns about racial, gender, socioeconomic, educational and geographic equity. Addressing inequity among residents caused by outmoded structures is a key issue among cities participating in Bloomberg Philanthropies\u2019\u00a0What Works Cities\u00a0initiative. These 100 cities are working to put the processes and policies in place to insert data at the center of their decision-making, with the goal of more effectively solving city challenges and providing the responsive services and engagement opportunities people have come to expect from their tech-savvy world.Cities have an opportunity to modernize themselves by incorporating data and technology within legacy systems. Cities are where Americans viscerally interact with their government. From roads to subways, cities are literally where the rubber meets the road. Cities are also increasingly taking an entrepreneurial approach.For example, Kansas City, Missouri, has a track record of effectively addressing issues deemed a priority in quarterly citizen surveys; as a result, in 2017, voters were willing to approve\u00a0an $800 million bond authorization (which will mean annual property tax increases for 20 years) so the City can address their dissatisfaction with the state of local infrastructure, like streets, sidewalks and roads.In Gilbert, Arizona, where the average age of residents is 32, the town went, in just six years, from having no established communications department to boasting a six-person\u00a0Office of Digital Government\u00a0responsible for \u201cdeveloping forward-thinking policies for and implementation of social media, digital communications, web initiatives and other tools to better serve the public.\u201dResidents can stay informed via any of the town\u2019s\u00a025+ social media channels. Other notable achievements include: the town\u2019s YouTube channel, including a \u201cYou Asked, We Answered\u201d video series that answers questions commonly received from residents via the town\u2019s website or social media platforms. Mayor Jenn Daniels also participates in a\u00a0Digital State of the Town video, rather than giving an annual address behind a podium. (This year, the town did a premiere screening at a local theater and sold out the tickets.) By bringing civic engagement into the digital age, Gilbert virtually invites residents to Town Hall \u2014 then to come inside and get involved wherever they are.\u00a0Cities are integrating the online power of data and tech with physical spaces to strengthen communities. In Charlotte,\u00a0Crown Town Hall,\u00a0a 2017\u00a0Knight Cities Challenge\u00a0winner, is helping residents connect with their local government through pop-up events and office hours with city managers.In Louisville, Kentucky,\u00a0LouieLab\u00a0is a hub where city employees, members of the civic tech community, residents and other innovators can come together to collaborate and strategize on how to achieve shared goals for Louisville\u2019s future. It also features a co-working space. Mayor Greg Fischer has a term for this focus on engagement:\u00a0building social muscle. He believes that transparent communication fosters trust with the community.\u201cIt helps set the tone for what citizens should expect,\u201d he says. The physical space of LouieLab is a manifestation of the city\u2019s commitment to open data, including leveraging data to evaluate when departments are (and are not) meeting their goals, through the city\u2019s\u00a0LouieStat\u00a0performance management program, which evaluates departments\u2019 work and shares progress with residents.In addition to creating open spaces for people to engage, we also need more opportunities for millennials to take their passion directly into City Hall. This requires\u00a0creating more pathways and fellowships to bring young people into local government jobs \u2014 and making it clear that these positions are intended to shake up the status quo.For example,\u00a0Chris Osgood, a co-founder of the Boston New Urban Mechanics, an innovation unit within the office of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, started his career on a\u00a0Harvard Business School Leadership Fellowship.\u00a0Code for America\u00a0is also working to place talented technologists into local government. Through its\u00a0Data Science Federation, the City of Los Angeles is partnering with local colleges and universities to accelerate its use of data-driven tools at the same time that it\u2019s creating a pipeline to bring new talent into local government.\u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find any position where you are a senior manager of a $3 billion organization that impacts people so directly,\u201d said Daniel Koh, former Chief of Staff to Mayor Walsh, who also joined City Hall via the Harvard Business School Fellowship. \u201cThere is no greater meaning in life than to use the education opportunities you have to make a difference in people\u2019s lives, and doing that for a city is so tangible.\u201dCities are also launching new roles such as chief innovation, information, data and technology officers.\u00a0Aaron Foley\u00a0is Detroit\u2019s chief storytelling officer, and\u00a0Regina Schwartz\u00a0is the Director of New York City\u2019s Public Engagement Unit, both new positions. There is a growing opportunity for passionate people to work in city government.Ultimately, cities should work to leverage this creativity and tap into people\u2019s passions, beliefs and capacities to affect change. Cities should be safe, fun and engaging communities for all residents, not just for the privileged. There is rightfully concern about the potential for data and technology to further inequality within cities. Richard Florida has documented the connection between innovation and inequality across global cities, where \u201cwinner-take-all urbanism\u201d has deepened inequality, segregation and poverty. Bruce Sterling recently wrote in\u00a0The Atlantic about the need to\u00a0\u201cstop saying \u2018smart cities\u2019\u201d\u00a0because of the risk that more affluent cities will reap the rewards of data and technology while leaving less affluent cities even further behind. There are also questions about\u00a0which cities millennials\u00a0will go to, or if we\u2019ve reached\u00a0peak millennial\u00a0in cities already. If educated millennials flock to big, coastal cities, what happens to other cities?Cities can proactively make policies and foster public-private partnerships, which harness people\u2019s creativity and address head on the question of inequality. One example: New York City launched the first\u00a0Neighborhood Innovation Lab\u00a0in Brownsville, Brooklyn.New York City is experimenting to see if Brownsville, which has the most densely concentrated area of public housing in the United States, can also be a hotbed of innovation. From tech literacy and coding skills to solar-powered benches and smart trash cans, the Lab in Brownsville is hoping to provide resources and unleash creativity.\u00a0Osborn Plaza, a public space in Brownsville, is the anchor of the initiative. As New York City\u2019s Chief Technology Officer Miguel Gamino\u00a0described\u00a0it: \u201cOur challenge\u2014and responsibility\u2014is to ensure these technologies reach and benefit all New Yorkers, not merely a select few.\u201dRe-engaging people in their civic and communal life is challenging. Nonetheless, practices of diverse U.S. mayors and dedicated city public administrators offer an opportunity for cities of all sizes to re-engage millennials (and others) with their democracy.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/millennials-could-be-the-answer-to-government-malaise/"},
{"title": ["Google matches 100 percent of its power consumption with renewables"], "text": "When you look at the number of datacenters the hyperscale companies are developing worldwide, it can be a little frightening from an energy usage standpoint, but Google  announced today that it acquired enough renewable energy to match 100 percent of its power consumption in 2017. That\u2019s good news, but it\u2019s not as good as using 100 percent renewable energy.The distinction is important. Think of this kind of purchase like a carbon offset. For every bit of polluting energy, they buy a corresponding bit of renewables. It\u2019s not ideal, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.Urz H\u00f6lzle, Google\u2019s senior vice president for technical infrastructure announced the milestone in a company blog post this morning. \u201cOver the course of 2017, across the globe, for every kilowatt-hour of electricity we consumed, we purchased a kilowatt-hour of renewable energy from a wind or solar farm that was built specifically for Google. This makes us the first public Cloud, and company of our size, to have achieved this feat,\u201d he wrote.While bragging, he could even take a swipe at rivals that Google was the strongest company in this regard, having purchased\u00a0three gigawatts (3GW) of output from renewable energy projects to the tune of $3 billion in energy investments. That\u2019s the kind of competition we need to see more of.He even included a graph to prove his point (and who doesn\u2019t like visuals?).Of course, the ultimate goal would be to use 100 percent renewables to power its vast network of datacenters around the world, and\u00a0H\u00f6lzle acknowledges that. \u201cWe say that we \u201cmatched\u201d our energy usage because it\u2019s not yet possible to \u201cpower\u201d a company of our scale by 100 percent renewable energy. It\u2019s true that for every kilowatt-hour of energy we consume, we add a matching kilowatt-hour of renewable energy to a power grid somewhere,\u201dThe company does hope one day to acquire all of its energy requirements from renewable sources, but until then this program is a way of giving back. \u201cThis program has always been a first step for us, but it is an important milestone in our race to a carbon-free future. We do want to get to a point where renewables and other carbon-free energy sources actually power our operations every hour of every day. It will take a combination of technology, policy and new deal structures to get there, but we\u2019re excited for the challenge,\u201d he wrote.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/google-matches-100-percent-of-its-power-consumption-with-renewables/"},
{"title": ["Burst breaks you out of your filter bubble on Reddit"], "text": "One of the many accusations about the trouble with Facebook \u2013 amid its data privacy concerns and enabling of Russian trolls \u2013 is that it keeps people locked into echo chambers where access to other viewpoints are limited. This is a common problem across social media, people are beginning to realize. A new app called Burst is experimenting with how to break people out of their bubbles. But its focus is not on Facebook, as it turns out \u2013 it\u2019s on Reddit.In a way, Reddit  has a problem with filter bubbles too, given that users choose which subreddits (communities) to subscribe to. That means than in addition to subscribing to something like r/politics, you may also subscribe to r/liberal or r/conservative, where you\u2019ll hear your own viewpoints echoed and reinforced.What Burst  does is combine everyone\u2019s comments and insights into one place. It works by finding everywhere a post has been re-shared across Reddit, then merges all the comments together.The app is organized like Reddit itself with sections for Hot, Top, Rising, New and Controversial as well as access to your own subreddits when you sign in. To view the comments on a post, you swipe to the left. And to upvote or downvote, you use Force Touch.Explains the app creator Alex Duckmanton, currently a product designer in Sydney, Burst has exposed him to different ideas.\u201cIn my own use of Burst while testing, I\u2019ve found that even though I see a lot more stuff I don\u2019t agree with, seeing it helps me empathise with other perspectives. It\u2019s my hope that this will help tone down some of the more toxic aspects of political discussion online,\u201d he says.While political discussions are often a hotbed for trolling and the general social media-induced lack of empathy, an app like Burst can help in other areas, too. For example, notes\u00a0Duckmanton, a post about the new iPhone might appear in both r/iphone and r/android, in addition to r/apple or r/technology. This allows you to see a wider array of discussions about the iPhone news, than if you only read the comments from one community.Duckmanton says he began to build Burst when he had some time off from work in the second-half of last year because he\u2019s been concerned about the impact of filter bubbles on social media platforms.\u201cFilter bubbles aren\u2019t being addressed in a meaningful way by any of the major social platforms,\u201d he says. \u201cThe typical response of banning problem users or removing content is a brute-force approach and isn\u2019t long-term or scalable. Outside of that, users are expected to self-manage the content they consume in order to have a more balanced view. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect that of people, and it certainly won\u2019t happen for people who aren\u2019t already engaged in news and politics,\u201d Duckmanton continues.\u201cWe need to create products in such a way that filter bubbles cannot exist because their design fundamentally prevents them,\u201dhe adds.The project is entirely self-funded and is currently supported by ads with the option to remove them via an in-app purchase.Now that the app is out in the wild,\u00a0Duckmanton says he\u2019ll see how the community reacts before deciding if he will transition to working on Burst full-time. If it were to take off, however, he imagines a future where a Burst-like app could be built for other platforms \u2013 like Twitter. But in the immediate-term, nothing like that is in the works.Burst is a free download for iOS.

Starting this week, owners of either the Fire 7 and the Fire HD 8 (2017) will be able to launch Alexa  using their voice, whenever the tablet\u2019s screen is in use or the device is connected to power.While Alexa has been available on Amazon\u2019s devices for some time, it wasn\u2019t until the Fire HD 10 arrived that Alexa could be used in a hands-free mode.

Of course, there are some drawbacks to Alexa on tablets. The speakers aren\u2019t as good as a full-sized Echo, and tablets don\u2019t have the mic array you\u2019d find on an Echo, either.

It also doesn\u2019t require a power connection.But because the Fire 7 or Fire 8 HD device has to be plugged in or the screen has to be in use, it\u2019s a better option for using the tablet as a smart display, rather than a full replacement for an Echo that works anytime.Amazon says the feature is rolling out this week.", "tags": [], "date": "2018-04-04 00:00:00", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/04/amazon-is-bringing-hands-free-alexa-to-fire-7-and-fire-hd-8-tablets/"}
